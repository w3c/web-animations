<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Web Animations defines a model for supporting animation and
synchronization on the Web platform.
It is intended that other specifications will build on this model and
expose its features through declarative means.
In addition, this specification also defines a programming interface to
the model that may be implemented by user agents that provide support
for scripting.

<h3 id="use-cases">Use cases</h3>

The Web Animations model is intended to provide the features necessary
for expressing CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]],
CSS Animations [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and
SVG [[SVG11]].
As such, the use cases of Web Animations model is the union of use cases for
those three specifications.

The use cases for the programming interface include the following:

:   Inspecting running animations
::  Often Web applications must wait for certain animated effects to complete
    before updating some state.
    The programming interface in this specification allows such applications
    to wait for all currently running animation to complete,
    regardless of whether they are defined by CSS Transitions, CSS Animations,
    SVG animations, or created directly using the programming interface.

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// Wait until all animations have finished before removing the element
Promise.all(
  elem.getAnimations().map(animation =&gt; animation.finished)
).then(() =&gt; elem.remove());
</pre>

    Alternatively, applications may wish to query the playback state of
    animations without waiting.

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
var isAnimating = elem.getAnimations().some(
  animation =&gt; animation.playState == 'running'
);
</pre>

:   Controlling running animations
::  It is sometimes useful to perform playback control on animations
    so that they can respond to external inputs.
    For example, it may be necessary to pause all existing animations before
    displaying a modal dialog so that they do not distract the user's
    attention.

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// Pause all existing animations in the document
document.timeline.getAnimations().forEach(
  animation =&gt; animation.pause()
);
</pre>

:   Creating animations from script
::  While it is possible to use ECMAScript to perform animation using
    <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> [[ANIMATION-TIMING]],
    such animations behave differently to declarative animation in terms of
    how they are represented in the CSS cascade and the performance
    optimizations that are possible such as performing the animation on a
    separate thread.
    Using the Web Animations programming interface, it is possible to
    create animations from script that have the same behavior and performance
    characteristics as declarative animations.

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// Fade out quickly
elem.animate({ transform: 'scale(0)', opacity: 0 }, 300);
</pre>

:   Animation debugging
::  In a complex application, it may be difficult to determine how an
    element arrived in its present state.
    The Web Animations programming interface may be used to inspect
    running animations to answer questions such as,
    &ldquo;Why is the opacity of this element changing?&rdquo;

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// Print the name of any opacity animations on elem
elem.getAnimations().filter(
  animation =&gt;
    animation.effect instanceof KeyframeEffectReadOnly &&
    animation.effect.getFrames().some(
      frame =&gt; frame.hasOwnProperty('opacity')
    )
).forEach(animation =&gt; console.log(animation.effect.name));
</pre>

    Likewise, in order to fine tune animations, it is often necessary to
    reduce their playback rate and replay them.

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// Slow down and replay any transform animations
elem.getAnimations().filter(
  animation =&gt;
    animation.effect instanceof KeyframeEffectReadOnly &&
    animation.effect.getFrames().some(
      frame =&gt; frame.hasOwnProperty('transform')
    )
).forEach(animation =&gt; {
  animation.currentTime = 0;
  animation.playbackRate = 0.5;
});
</pre>

:   Testing animations
::  In order to test applications that make use of animations it is often
    impractical to wait for such animations to run to completion.
    Rather, it is desirable to seek the animations to specific times.

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// Seek to the half-way point of an animation and check that the opacity is 50%
elem.getAnimations().forEach(
  animation =&gt;
    animation.currentTime =
      animation.effect.computedTiming.delay +
      animation.effect.computedTiming.activeDuration / 2;
);
assert_equals(getComputedStyle(elem).opacity, 0.5);

// Check that the loading screen is hidden after the animations finish
elem.getAnimations().forEach(
  animation =&gt; animation.finish()
);
// Wait one frame so that event handlers have a chance to run
requestAnimationFrame(() =&gt; {
  assert_equals(
    getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('#loading')).display, 'none');
});
</pre>

<!-- @if LEVEL=2 -->
<h3 id="changes-since-level-1">Changes since level 1</h3>

This specification introduces the following changes compared to the
previous level of this specification:

*   <a>group effects</a> and <a>sequence effects</a>,
*   an <a>animation effect</a>-specific
    <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a>,
*   <a>custom effects</a>.

<!-- @endif -->

<h3 id="relationship-to-other-specifications">Relationship to other specifications</h3>

CSS Transitions [[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]], CSS Animations [[CSS3-ANIMATIONS]], and
SVG [[SVG11]] all provide mechanisms that
generate animated content on a Web page.
Although the three specifications provide many similar features,
they are described in different terms.
This specification proposes an abstract animation model that
encompasses the common features of all three specifications.
This model is backwards-compatible with the current behavior of these
specifications such that they can be defined in terms of this model
without any observable change.

The animation features in SVG 1.1 are defined in terms of SMIL
Animation [[SMIL-ANIMATION]].
It is intended that by defining SVG's animation features in terms of
the Web Animations model, the dependency between SVG and SMIL
Animation can be removed.

As with Timing control for script-based animations (commonly referred
to as &ldquo;requestAnimationFrame&rdquo;) [[ANIMATION-TIMING]],
the programming interface component of this specification allows
animations to be created from script.
The animations created using the interface defined in this
specification, however, once created, are executed entirely by the
user agent meaning they share the same performance characteristics as
animations defined by markup.
Using this interface it is possible to create animations
from script in a simpler and more performant manner.

The time values used within the programming interface
correspond with those used in Timing control for script-based
animations [[ANIMATION-TIMING]] and their execution order is defined
such that the two interfaces can be used simultaneously without conflict.

The programming interface component of this specification makes
some additions to interfaces defined in HTML5 [[HTML5]].

<h3 id="overview-of-this-specification">Overview of this specification</h3>

This specification begins by defining an abstract model for animation.
This is followed by a programming interface defined in terms of the
abstract model.
The programming interface is defined in terms of the abstract model
and is only relevant to user agents that provide scripting support.

<h2 id="web-animations-model-overview">Web Animations model overview</h2>

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

At a glance, the Web Animations model consists of two largely
independent pieces, a <em>timing model</em> and an <em>animation
model</em>.  The role of these pieces is as follows:

:   Timing model
::  Takes a moment in time and converts it to a proportional distance
    within a single iteration of an animation called the <em>iteration
    progress</em>.
    The <em>iteration index</em> is also recorded since some animations vary
    each time they repeat.
:   Animation model
::  Takes the <em>iteration progress</em> values and <em>iteration indices</em>
    produced by the timing model and converts them into a series of values
    to apply to the target properties and attributes.

Graphically, this flow can be represented as follows:
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/timing-and-animation-models.svg" width="600" alt="Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
Overview of the operation of the Web Animations model.<br>
The current time is input to the timing model which produces an iteration
progress value and an iteration index.<br>
These parameters are used as input to the animation model which produces
the values to apply.<br>
</p>

For example, consider an animation that:

*   starts after 3 seconds
*   runs twice,
*   takes 2 seconds every time, and
*   changes the width of a rectangle from 50 pixels to 100 pixels.

The first three points apply to the timing model.
At a time of 6 seconds, it will calculate that the animation should be
half-way through its second iteration and produces the result 0.5.
The animation model then uses that information to calculate a width.

This specification begins with the timing model and then proceeds to
the animation model.

</div>

<h2 id="timing-model">Timing model</h2>

This section describes and defines the behavior of the Web Animations
timing model.

<h3 id="the-timing-model-at-a-glance">The timing model at a glance</h3>

<div class='informative-bg'>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

Two features characterise the Web Animations timing model: it is
<em>stateless</em> and it is <em>hierarchical</em>.

<h4 id="stateless">Stateless</h4>

The Web Animations timing model operates by taking an input time and
producing an output iteration progress.
Since the output is based solely on the input time and is independent
of previous inputs, the model may be described as stateless.
This gives the model the following properties:


:   Frame-rate independent
::  Since the output is independent of previous inputs, the rate at
    which the model is sampled will not affect its progress.
    Provided the input times are proportional to the progress of
    real-world time, animations will progress at an identical rate
    regardless of the capabilities of the device running them.
:   Direction-agnostic
::  Since the sequence of inputs is insignificant, the model is
    directionless.
    This means that the model can be sampled in reverse or even in
    a backwards and forwards pattern without requiring any specialized
    handling.
:   Constant-time seeking
::  Since each input is independent of the previous input, the
    processing required to perform a seek operation, even far into the
    future, is at least potentially constant.

There are a few exceptions to the stateless behavior of the timing
model.

Firstly, a number of methods defined in the <a
href="#programming-interface" section>programming interface</a> to the model
provide play control such as pausing an animation.
These methods are defined in terms of the time at which they are
called and are therefore stative.
These methods are provided primarily for convenience and are not part
of the core timing model but are layered on top.

Similarly, the <a href="#reaching-the-end" section>finishing behavior</a> of
animations means that dynamic changes to the end time of
the media (target effect) of an animation may produce a
different result depending on when the change occurs.
This behavior is somewhat unfortunate but has been deemed intuitive
and consistent with HTML.
As a result, the model can only truly be described as stateless
<em>in the absence of dynamic changes to its timing properties</em>.

Finally, each time the model is sampled, it can be considered to
establish a temporary state.
While this temporary state affects the values returned from the <a
href="#programming-interface" section>programming interface</a>, it has no
influence on the subsequent samples and hence does not conflict with
the stateless qualities described above.

<h4 id="hierarchical">Hierarchical</h4>

The other characteristic feature of the Web Animations timing model is
that time is inherited.
Time begins with a monotonically increasing time source and cascades
down a number of steps to each animation.
At each step, time may be shifted backwards and forwards, scaled,
reversed, paused, and repeated.

<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">
  A hierarchy of timing nodes.
  Each node in the tree derives its time from its parent node.

</p>

<!-- @ifndef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
In this level of the specification the hierarchy is shallow.
A subsequent level of this specification will introduce the concept
of group effects which allows for deeper timing hierarchies.
<!-- @endif -->

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
A consequence of this hierarchical arrangement is that complex
animation arrangements can be reversed, scheduled, accelerated and so
on as a whole unit since the manipulations applied to the parent,
cascade down to its <a>descendants</a>.
Furthermore, since time has a common source, it is easy to synchronize
animations.
<!-- @endif -->

</div>

<h3 id="timing-model-concepts">Timing model concepts</h3>

In Web Animations, timing is based on a hierarchy of time relationships
between timing nodes.
Parent nodes provide timing information to their child nodes in the form
of <a>time values</a>.
A <dfn>time value</dfn> is a real number which nominally represents
a number of milliseconds from some moment.
The connection between <a>time values</a> and wall-clock milliseconds
may be obscured by any number of transformations applied to the value as
it passes through the time hierarchy.

<p class="annotation">
In the future we may have timelines that are based on UI gestures in
which case the connection between time values and milliseconds will be
weakened even further.
</p>

A <a>time value</a> may also be <dfn>unresolved</dfn> if, for example,
a timing node is not in a state to produce a <a>time value</a>.

Periodically, the user agent will update the timing model in a process called
<dfn>sampling</dfn>.
On each <dfn lt='single-sample'>sample</dfn> the
<a>time values</a> of each timing node are updated.

Further requirements on the frequency and sequencing of <a>sampling</a>
are specified by HTML's <a
  href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-9">processing
  model</a> [[!HTML]].

Note: HTML currently refers to a &ldquo;<a
  href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#run-css-animations-and-send-events">run
  CSS animations and send events</a>&rdquo; operation but this should be
understood to include sampling <em>all</em> animations covered by this
specification, not only CSS animations.
Furthermore, the <var>now</var> parameter passed to this operation is ignored
in this specification since we define a more general model that supports
timelines whose time origin is not relative to <code>navigationStart</code>.

<h3 id="the-global-clock">The global clock</h3>

At the root of the Web Animations timing hierarchy is the <a>global
clock</a>.

The <dfn>global clock</dfn> is a source of monotonically increasing
<a>time values</a> unaffected by adjustments to the system clock.
The <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global clock</a> represent
wall-clock milliseconds from an unspecified historical moment.
Because the zero time of the <a>global clock</a> is not specified,
the absolute values of the <a>time values</a> produced by the <a>global
clock</a> are not significant, only their rate of change.

Note: The <a>global clock</a> is not exposed in the <a
    href="#programming-interface">programming interface</a> and nor is it
    expected to be exposed by markup.
    As a result the moment from which <a>global clock</a> <a>time values</a>
    are measured, that is, the zero time of the clock, is
    implementation-dependent.
    One user agent may measure the number of milliseconds since the the user
    agent was loaded whilst another may use the time when the device was
    started.
    Both approaches are acceptable and produce no observable difference
    in the output of the model.


<h3 id="timelines">Timelines</h3>

A <dfn>timeline</dfn> provides a source of <a>time values</a> for the
purpose of synchronization.

Typically, a <a>timeline</a> is tied to the <a>global clock</a> such
that its absolute time is calculated as a fixed offset from the time of
the <a>global clock</a>.
This offset is established by designating some moment as the timeline's
<dfn>zero time</dfn> and recording the <a>time value</a> of the
<a>global clock</a> at that moment.
At subsequent moments, the <a>time value</a> of the timeline is
calculated as the difference between the current <a>time value</a> of
the <a>global clock</a> and the value recorded at the <a>zero time</a>.

On each <a lt=single-sample>sample</a>, the <a>time value</a> of the
<a>global clock</a> at the beginning of the sample is recorded and this
recorded value is used as the time value of the global clock until the
next sample.

Note: We anticipate that other types of timelines may be introduced
  in the future that are not tied to the global clock.
  For example, a timeline whose time values are related to the progress of
  a UI gesture.

Since a <a>timeline</a> may be defined relative to a moment that has yet
to occur, it may not always be able to return a meaningful <a>time
value</a>, but only an <a>unresolved</a> time value.
A <a>timeline</a> is considered to be
<dfn lt="inactive timeline">inactive</dfn>
when its <a>time value</a> is <a>unresolved</a>.

<h4 id="document-timelines">Document timelines</h4>

A <dfn>document timeline</dfn> is a <a>timeline</a> that is associated with
a document.

The <a>time values</a> of a <a>document timeline</a> are calculated
as a fixed offset from the <a>global clock</a> such that the <a>zero
time</a> corresponds to the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/#dom-performancetiming-navigationstart">
<code>navigationStart</code></a> moment [[!NAVIGATION-TIMING]] plus a
signed delta known as the <dfn>origin time</dfn>.
Prior to establishing the <code>navigationStart</code> moment, the <a>document
timeline</a> is <a lt="inactive timeline">inactive</a>.

A <a>document timeline</a> that is associated with a document which is not
an <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#active-document"
class="externalDFN">active document</a> is also considered to be
<a lt="inactive timeline">inactive</a>.

<h4 id="the-documents-default-timeline">The default document timeline</h4>

Each <a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-document">document</a>
([[!DOM]]) has a <a>document timeline</a> called the <dfn>default document
timeline</dfn>.
The <a>default document timeline</a> is unique to each document and persists for
the lifetime of the document including calls to <a
  href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#dom-document-open"><code>document.open()</code></a> [[!HTML5]].

The <a>default document timeline</a> has an <a>origin time</a> of zero.

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Since the <a>document timelines</a> are tied to the <a>global
clock</a> by a fixed offset, <a>time values</a> reported by
<a>document timelines</a> increase monotonically.
Furthermore, since no scaling is applied, these <a>time values</a>
are proportional to wall-clock milliseconds.

Since the <a>time values</a> of the <a>default document timeline</a> are
relative to the <code>navigationStart</code> time,
<code>document.timeline.currentTime</code> will roughly correspond to
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time/#dom-performance-now">
<code>Performance.now()</code></a>
[[HR-TIME]] with the exception that
<code>document.timeline.currentTime</code> does not change within
a <a>sample</a>.

</div>

<h3 id="animations">Animations</h3>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The children of a <a>timeline</a> are called <em>animations</em>.
An animation takes an <a>animation effect</a> which is a static
description of some timed behavior and binds it to a <a>timeline</a>
so that it runs.
An animation also allows run-time control of the connection between the
<a>animation effect</a> and its <a>timeline</a> by providing pausing,
seeking, and speed control.
The relationship between an animation and an <a>animation effect</a> is
analogous to that of a DVD player and a DVD.
</div>

An <dfn id="concept-animation">animation</dfn> connects a single <a>animation
effect</a>, called its <dfn>target effect</dfn>, to a <a>timeline</a> and
provides playback control.
Both of these associations are optional and configurable such that
an <a>animation</a> may have no associated <a>target effect</a> or
<a>timeline</a> at a given moment.

An <a>animation</a>'s <dfn lt="animation start time">start time</dfn> is the
<a>time value</a> of its <a>timeline</a> when its <a>target effect</a>
is scheduled to begin playback. An animation's <a
lt="animation start time">start time</a> is initially
<a>unresolved</a>.

An <a>animation</a> also maintains a <dfn>hold time</dfn> <a>time value</a>
which is used to fix the animation's output <a>time value</a>, called its
<a>current time</a>, in circumstances such as pausing</a>.
The <a>hold time</a> is initially <a>unresolved</a>.

In order to establish the priority of conflicting <a>animations</a>, each
animation has an associated <dfn>animation sequence number</dfn> that is
assigned a globally unique sequence number each time it transitions
out of the <a>idle play state</a>.

<h4 id="setting-the-timeline">Setting the timeline of a animation</h4>

The procedure to <dfn>set the timeline of an animation</dfn>,
<var>animation</var>, to <var>new timeline</var> which may be null, is as
follows:

1.  Let <var>old timeline</var> be the current <a>timeline</a> of
    <var>animation</var>, if any.
1.  If <var>new timeline</var> is the same object as <var>old timeline</var>,
    abort this procedure.
1.  Let <var>previous animation time</var> be the <a>current time</a> of
    <var>animation</var>.
1.  If <var>new timeline</var> is null and <var>old timeline</var> is not null,
    run the procedure to <a>reset an animation's pending tasks</a> on

    <p class="note">
      Note that if <var>new timeline</var> is not null and <var>animation</var>
      has a <a>pending play task</a> or a <a>pending pause task</a> no special

      <a>animation</a> is <a>ready</a> even though this may occur at a different
      moment than it might have done with the old timeline.
    </p>
1.  Let the <a>timeline</a> of <var>animation</var> be <var>new timeline</var>.

    run the procedure to <a>silently set the current time</a> of
    <var>animation</var> to <var>previous animation time</a>.
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_CUSTOM_EFFECTS -->
1.  Issue: If <var>new timeline</var> is null, we should ensure that <a>custom

<h4 id='waiting-for-the-target-effect'>Waiting for the target effect</h4>

<div class='informative-bg'>

<em>This section is non-normative</em>

Some operations performed by an <a>animation</a> may not occur
instantaneously.
For example, some user agents may delegate the playback of an
animation to a separate process or to specialized graphics hardware
each of which may incur some setup overhead.

If such an animation is timed from the moment when the animation was
triggered there may be a significant jump between the first and second
frames of the animation corresponding to the setup time involved.

To avoid this problem, Web Animations typically begins timing
animations from the moment when the first frame of the animation is
complete.
This is represented by an <a>unresolved</a> <a
lt="animation start time">start time</a> on the <a>animation</a> which becomes
resolved when the animation is <a>ready</a>.
Content may opt out of this behavior by setting the <a
lt="animation start time">start time</a>
to a <a lt="unresolved">resolved</a> <a>time value</a>.

</div>

An animation is <dfn>ready</dfn> at the first moment where <em>both</em> of the
following conditions are true:

*   the user agent has completed any setup required to begin the playback of
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
    each <a>inclusive descendant</a> of

    the animation's <a>target effect</a>

<h4 id='the-current-ready-promise'>The current ready promise</h4>

Each <a>animation</a> has a <dfn>current ready promise</dfn>.
The <a>current ready promise</a> is initially a resolved <a>Promise</a> created
using the procedure to <a>create a new resolved Promise</a>.

The object is replaced with a new <a>Promise</a> object every time the animation
enters the <a>pending play state</a> as well as when the animation is
cancelled (see <a href="#cancelling-an-animation-section" section></a>).

<div class="note">

    Note that since the same object is used for both pending play and
    pending pause requests, authors are advised to check the state of the
    animation when the <a>Promise</a> is resolved.

    For example, in the following code fragment, the state of the animation
    will be <a lt="running play state">running</a> when the
    <a>current ready promise</a> is resolved.
    This is because the animation does not leave the <a>pending play state</a>
    in between the calls to <code>pause</code> and
    <code>play</code> and hence the <a>current ready promise</a> does
    not change.

    <pre class='example lang-javascript'>
animation.pause();
animation.ready.then(function() {
  // Displays 'running'

<a>target effect</a> or play backwards past time zero.

An animation that has reached the natural boundary of its playback range
is said to have <em>finished</em>.

Graphically, the effect of limiting the current time is shown below.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/limiting.svg" width="500"
       alt="The effect of limiting the current time of an animation.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
The effect of limiting the <a>current time</a> of an <a>animation</a>
with a start time of 1s, a target effect of length 3s, and
a positive <a>animation playback rate</a>.
After the <a>current time</a> of the animation reaches the end of the
target effect, it is capped at 3s.
</p>

It is possible, however, to <em>seek</em> the <a>current time</a> of
an <a>animation</a> to a time past the end of the <a>target effect</a>.
When doing so, the <a>current time</a> will not progress but the
animation will act as if it had been paused at the seeked time.

This allows, for example, seeking the <a>current time</a> of
an animation with <em>no</em> <a>target effect</a> to 5s.
If <a>target effect</a> with an <a>end time</a> later than 5s is
later associated with the animation, playback will begin from the 5s
mark.

Similar behavior to the above scenario may arise when the
length of an animation's <a>target effect</a> changes.

Similarly, when the <a>animation playback rate</a> is negative, the
<a>current time</a> does not progress past time zero.

</div>

<h4 id="the-current-finished-promise">The current finished promise</h4>

Each animation has a <dfn>current finished promise</dfn>.
The <a>current finished promise</a> is initially a pending <a>Promise</a>
object.

The object is replaced with a new (pending) <a>Promise</a> object every time
the animation leaves the <a>finished play state</a>.

<h4 id="updating-the-finished-state">Updating the finished state</h4>

For an animation with a positive <a lt="animation playback rate">playback
rate</a>, the <a>current time</a> continues to increase until it
reaches the <a>target effect end</a>.

The <dfn>target effect end</dfn> of an animation is equal to the <a>end
time</a> of the animation's <a>target effect</a>.
If the animation has no <a>target effect</a>, the <a>target effect
end</a> is zero.

An animation with a negative <a lt="animation playback rate">playback
rate</a>, the <a>current time</a> continues to decrease until it
reaches zero.

A running animation that has reached this boundary (or overshot it) and has a
<a lt="unresolved">resolved</a> <a>animation start time</a>
is said to be <a lt="finished play state">finished</a>.

The crossing of this boundary is checked on each modification to the
animation object using the procedure to <a>update an animation's finished
state</a> defined below. This procedure is also run on each <a>sample</a>
and each time the timing properties of the <a>target effect</a> associated
with an <a>animation</a> are updated.

Issue: At least with regards to resolving promises / dispatching finish events,
       it might be better to queue a task for that, and if the animation is
       still finished when the task runs, resolve the promise / dispatch
       the event. That way scripts don't need to be so careful about the order
       in which they make timing changes.

For each animation, the user agent maintains a <dfn>previous current
time</dfn> <a>time value</a> that is originally <a>unresolved</a>,
and a <dfn>previous finished state</dfn> boolean flag that is
initially false.

Whilst during normal playback the <a>current time</a> of an <a>animation</a> is
limited to the boundaries described above, it is possible to seek the <a>current
time</a> of an <a>animation</a> to times outside those boundaries using the
procedure to <a>set the current time</a> of an <a>animation</a>.

The procedure to <dfn>update an animation's finished state</dfn> for
<var>animation</var>, given a flag <var>did seek</var> (to indicate if
the update is being performed after <a lt="set the current time">setting the
current time</a>), is as follows:

1.  If both of the following conditions are true,

    *   <var>animation</var>'s <a lt="animation start time">start time</a> is
        <a lt="unresolved">resolved</a>, and
    *   <var>animation</var> does <em>not</em> have a <a>pending play task</a>
        or a <a>pending pause task</a>,

    then update <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> based on the first
    matching condition for <var>animation</var> from below, if any:

    <div class='switch'>

<h4 id="finishing-an-animation-section">Finishing an animation</h4>

An animation can be advanced to the natural end of its current playback
direction by using the procedure to <dfn>finish an animation</dfn>
for <var>animation</var> defined below:

1.  If <a>animation playback rate</a> is zero,
    or if <a>animation playback rate</a> &gt; 0 and <a>target effect end</a> is
    infinity,
    <a href="http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-throw">throw</a> an
    <span class=exceptionname>InvalidStateError</span> and abort these steps.

1.  Set <var>limit</var> as follows:

    <div class="switch">

    :   If <a>animation playback rate</a> &gt; 0,</dt>
    ::  Let <var>limit</var> be <a>target effect end</a>.</dd>

    :   Otherwise,
    ::  Let <var>limit</var> be zero.</dd>

    </div>

1.  <a>Set the current time</a> to <var>limit</var>.

    <div class="annotation">
        The procedure for setting the current time has the side effect of
        cancelling any <a>pending pause task</a> so we don't need to
        handle that here.
    </div>

1.  If <var>animation</var>'s <a lt="animation start time">start time</a> is
    <a>unresolved</a> and <var>animation</var> has an associated <a
    lt="inactive timeline">active</a> <a>timeline</a>, let the <a
    lt="animation start time">start time</a> be the result of evaluating
    <code><var>timeline time</var> -
    (<var>limit</var> / <a lt="animation playback rate">playback
    rate</a>)</code> where <var>timeline time</var> is the current <a>time
    value</a> of the associated <a>timeline</a>.

1.  If there is a <a>pending play task</a> and <a
    lt="animation start time">start time</a> is <a lt="unresolved">resolved</a>,
    cancel that task and <a lt="resolve a Promise">resolve</a> the <a>current
    ready promise</a> of <var>animation</var> with <var>animation</var>.

1.  Run the procedure to <a>update an animation's finished state</a>
    <var>animation</var> with the <var>did seek</var> flag set to true.

Note: Finishing an animation does not necessarily cause that animation
to enter the <a>finished play state</a>. In particular, if an animation was in the
<a>paused play state</a> before finishing, it will remain in the
<a>paused play state</a> afterwards.

<h4 id='cancelling-an-animation-section'>Cancelling an animation</h4>

An animation can be cancelled which causes the <a>current time</a> to
become <a>unresolved</a> hence removing any effects caused by the
<a>target effect</a>.

The procedure to <dfn>cancel an animation</dfn> for <var>animation</var> is
as follows:

1.  Run the procedure to <a>reset an animation's pending tasks</a> on
    <var>animation</var>.
2.  <a lt="reject a Promise">Reject</a> the <a>current finished promise</a>
    with a DOMException named "AbortError".

    Issue: If <var>animation</var> is already <a lt="idle play state">idle</a>
    should we just keep the existing finished promise and not reject it?
    That seems more intuitive but the current behavior where
    <code>cancel()</code> <em>always</em> rejects the <a>current finished
    promise</a> might also be more useful/reliable?

3.  Let <a>current finished promise</a> be a new (pending) <a>Promise</a>
    object.
4.  Make <var>animation</var>'s <a>hold time</a> <a>unresolved</a>.
5.  Make <var>animation</var>'s <a lt="animation start time">start time</a>
    <a>unresolved</a>.

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_CUSTOM_EFFECTS -->
6.  Queue a task to call any <a>custom effects</a> associated with
    <a>inclusive descendants</a> of
    <var>animation</var>'s <a>target effect</a>
    with an <a>unresolved</a> iteration progress.

    Issue: The procedures for calling custom effects need to be reworked.
           Currently they probably involve calling too often for changes that
           could be coalesced.

<h4 id="speed-control">Speed control</h4>

<div class="informative-bg">

The rate of play of an animation can be controlled by setting its
<em>playback rate</em>.
For example, setting a playback rate of 2 will cause the animation's
<a>current time</a> to increase at twice the rate of its <a>timeline</a>.
Similarly, a playback rate of -1 will cause the animation's <a>current
time</a> to decrease at the same rate as the <a>time values</a> from
its <a>timeline</a> increase.

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_ANIMATION_NODE_PLAYBACKRATE -->
Note that <a>animation effects</a> also have a <a
lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a> associated
with them that behaves differently to that defined here.
<!-- @endif -->

</div>

<a>Animations</a> have a <dfn lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</dfn>
that provides a scaling factor from the rate of change of the associated
<a>timeline</a>'s <a>time values</a> to the animation's <a>current time</a>.
The <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a> is initially 1.

Setting an animation's <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a>
to zero effectively pauses the animation (however, the <a>play state</a>
does not necessarily become <a lt="paused play state">paused</a>).

<h5 id="updating-the-playback-rate-of-an-animation">Updating the playback rate of an animation</h5>

Changes to the <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a>
trigger a compensatory seek so that that the animation's
<a>current time</a> is unaffected by the change to the playback
rate.

The procedure to <dfn>set the animation playback rate</dfn> of
an <a>animation</a>, <var>animation</var> to <var>new playback rate</var>
is as follows:

1.  Let <var>previous time</var> be the value of the
    <a>current time</a> of <var>animation</var> before changing the
    <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a>.
2.  Set the <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a> to
    <var>new playback rate</var>.
3.  If <var>previous time</var> is <a lt="unresolved">resolved</a>,
    <a>set the current time</a> of <var>animation</var> to
    <var>previous time</var>.

The procedure to <dfn>silently set the animation playback rate</dfn>
of <a>animation</a>, <var>animation</var> to <var>new playback rate</var>
is identical to the above procedure except that rather than invoking
the procedure to <a>set the current time</a> in the final step, the
procedure to <a>silently set the current time</a> is invoked instead.

<h4 id="reversing-an-animation-section">Reversing an animation</h4>

The procedure to <dfn>reverse an animation</dfn> of <a>animation</a>
<var>animation</var> is as follows:

1.  If there is no <a>timeline</a> associated with <var>animation</var>, or the
    associated <a>timeline</a> is <a lt="inactive timeline">inactive</a>
    <a href="http://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-throw">throw</a> an
    <span class=exceptionname>InvalidStateError</span> and abort these steps.
2.  <a>Silently set the animation playback rate</a> of
    <var>animation</var> to <code>&minus;<a>animation playback rate</a></code>.

    <div class="annotation">
        This must be done silently or else we may end up resolving
        the <a>current ready promise</a> when we do the compensatory
        seek despite the fact that we are most likely not exiting the
        <a>pending play state</a>.
    </div>
3.  Run the steps to <a>play an animation</a> for <var>animation</var>.

<h4 id="play-states">Play states</h4>

An <a>animation</a> may be described as being in one of the following
<dfn lt="play state">play states</dfn> for each of which, a 
non-normative description is also provided:

<div class=informative-bg>

:   <a lt="idle play state">idle</a>
::  The <a>current time</a> of the animation is <a>unresolved</a> and
    there are no pending tasks.

::  The animation is waiting on some pending task to complete.
:   <a lt="running play state">running</a>
::  The animation has a resolved <a>current time</a> that changes on each
    <a>sample</a> (provided the <a>animation playback rate</a> is not zero).

::  The animation has been suspended and the <a>current time</a>
    is no longer changing.
:   <a lt="finished play state">finished</a>
::  The animation has reached the natural boundary of its playback range
    and the <a>current time</a> is no longer updating.

<div class="note">

Note that the <a>paused play state</a> effectively

be converted from a <a lt="paused play state">paused</a>
animation into a <a lt="finished play state">finished</a> animation
without restarting by setting the <a>animation start time</a> such as below:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>

In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
These different points of reference produce different <em>time

This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer

The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
a coordinate space.

Just as with coordinate spaces, time spaces can also be nested.
<a>Group effects</a> typically perform some
transformations on the <a>time values</a> they

Child <a>animation effects</a> then operate <em>within</em> that

<h4 id="animation-effect-phases-and-states">Animation effect phases and
states</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

At a given moment, an <a>animation effect</a> may be in one of three
possible <em>phases</em>.
If an <a>animation effect</a> has an <a>unresolved</a> <a>local
time</a> it will not be in any phase.

The different phases are illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/animation-effect-phases-and-states.svg" width="700"

         describe an animation effect.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
An example of the different phases and states used to describe
an <a>animation effect</a>.
</p>

The phases are as follows:

:   <a>before phase</a>
::  The <a>animation effect</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls before the
    effect's <a>active interval</a>.
:   <a>active phase</a>
::  The <a>animation effect</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls inside the
    effect's <a>active interval</a>.
:   <a>after phase</a>
::  The <a>animation effect</a>'s <a>local time</a> falls after the
    effect's <a>active interval</a>.

In addition to these phases, an <a>animation effect</a> may also be
described as being in one of several overlapping <em>states</em>.
These states are only established for the duration of a single
sample and are primarily a convenience for describing stative parts
of the model.

These states and their useage within the model are summarised as
follows:

:   <a>in play</a>
::  Corresponds to an <a>animation effect</a> whose <a>active time</a>
    is changing on each sample.
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
    This occurs when the <a>animation effect</a> <em>and all its
    ancestors</em> are in the <a>active phase</a>.
    <a>Animation effects</a> only &ldquo;move&rdquo; when
    they are <a>in play</a>.

    It is possible for an <a>animation effect</a> to be in the
    <a>active phase</a> but not <a>in play</a>.
    For example, if an <a>animation effect</a> has a <a>parent
    group</a> that causes the animation effect's <a>active
    interval</a> to be clipped and both parent and child apply the
    same <a>fill mode</a>, the child <a>animation effect</a> may be
    effectively be snapshotted within the <a>active phase</a>
    despite no longer being <a>in play</a>.
<!-- @endif -->

:   <a>current</a>
::  Corresponds to an <a>animation effect</a> that is either <a>in
    play</a> or may become <a>in play</a> in the future.
    This will be the case if the <a>animation effect</a> is <a>in
    play</a> or in its <a>before phase</a>, <em>or</em> it has an
    ancestor for which this is true thereby opening up the
    possibility that this <a>animation effect</a> might play again
    (e.g. due to repeating).

:   <a>in effect</a>
::  Corresponds to an <a>animation effect</a> that has a resolved
    <a>active time</a>.
    This occurs when either the <a>animation effect</a> is in its
    <a>active phase</a> or outside the <a>active interval</a> but at
    a time where the effect's <a>fill mode</a> (see <a
    href="#fill-behavior" section></a>) causes its
    <a>active time</a> to be resolved.
    Only <a>in effect</a> <a>animation effects</a> apply
    a result to their target.

The normative definition of each of these states follows.

</div>

An <a>animation effect</a> is in the <dfn>before phase</dfn> if the

<h3 id="fill-behavior">Fill behavior</h3>

The effect of an <a>animation effect</a> when it is not <a>in play</a> is
determined by its <dfn>fill mode</dfn>.

The possible <a>fill modes</a> are:

*   none,
*   forwards,

The normative definition of these modes is incorporated in the

<h4 id="fill-modes">Fill modes</h4>

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Note: setting a fill mode has no bearing on the endpoints of the

    However, the fill mode <em>does</em> have an effect on various other

    the <a>active interval</a> <em>or</em> when a fill is applied.

<div class="issue">
Currently <a>timing functions</a> that generate results outside the
range [0, 1] will behave unexpectedly when applied to group
effects, as children will increase iterations or enter into fill mode
rather than continuing to extrapolate along their defined behavior
(which is what they would do if the timing function applied to them
directly).

To fix this it is possible we will wish to introduce 'overflow' fill
modes that respond to time values larger than or smaller than the
active time range by extrapolating rather than filling.

<h3 id="repeating">Repeating</h3>

<h4 id="iteration-intervals">Iteration intervals</h4>

It is possible to specify that an animation effect should repeat
a fixed number of times or indefinitely.
This repetition occurs <em>within</em> the <a>active interval</a>.
The span of time during which a single repetition takes place is
called an <dfn>iteration interval</dfn>.

Unlike the <a>active interval</a>, an animation effect can have multiple
<a>iteration intervals</a> although typically only the interval
corresponding to the <a>current iteration</a> is of interest.

The length of a single iteration is called the <dfn>iteration
duration</dfn>.
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->The initial <a>iteration duration</a> of an
animation effect is simply its <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a>.

The <dfn>intrinsic iteration duration</dfn> of an animation effect is
zero, however some specific types of animation effect such as
<a>group effects</a> override this behavior and provide an
alternative intrinsic duration (see <a
href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-group-effect"
section></a> and <a
href="#the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-sequence-effect"
section></a>).

The <a>iteration duration</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> may be set
by the author to represent a value other than the <a>intrinsic
iteration duration</a>.

<!-- @endif -->
<!-- @ifndef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->The initial <a>iteration duration</a> of an
animation effect is zero.

<!-- @endif -->

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Comparing the <a>iteration duration</a> and the <a>active
duration</a> we have:

:   Iteration duration
::  The time taken for a single iteration of the animation effect to
    complete.
:   Active duration
::  The time taken for the entire animation effect to complete,
    including repetitions.
    This may be longer or shorter than the <a>iteration duration</a>.

The relationship between the <a>iteration duration</a> and <a>active
duration</a> is illustrated below.

<h4 id="controlling-iteration">Controlling iteration</h4>

The number of times an <a>animation effect</a> repeats is called its
<dfn>iteration count</dfn>.
The <a>iteration count</a> is a real number greater than or equal to
zero.
The <a>iteration count</a> may also be positive infinity to represent
that the <a>animation effect</a> repeats indefinitely.

In addition to the <a>iteration count</a>, <a>animation effects</a> also
have an <dfn>iteration start</dfn> property which specifies an offset
into the series of iterations at which the <a>animation effect</a>
should begin.
The <a>iteration start</a> is a finite real number greater than or
equal to zero.

The behavior of these parameters is defined in the calculations in <a
href="#core-animation-effect-calculations" section></a>.

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The effect of the <a>iteration count</a> and <a>iteration start</a>
parameters is illustrated below.

  interval</a>.<br>
  The second case is the same but with an <a>iteration start</a> of
  0.5.
  This causes the <a>animation effect</a> to begin half way through the
  first iteration.
</p>

Unlike the <a>iteration count</a> parameter, the <a>iteration
start</a> parameter does not effect the length of the <a>active

Note that values of <a>iteration start</a> greater than or equal to

<h4 id="iteration-time-space">Iteration time space</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

<!-- @ifndef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
In Web Animations all times are relative to some point of reference.
These different points of reference produce different <em>time
spaces</em>.

This can be compared to coordinate spaces as used in computer
graphics.
The zero time of a time space is analogous to the origin of
a coordinate space.

We can describe animations that repeat as establishing a new time space
each time the animation repeats: the <em>iteration time space</em>.

<!-- @endif -->
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
We have already encountered different time spaces in describing
<a>local time</a> and <a>inherited time</a> (see <a
href="#local-time-and-inherited-time" section></a>).
Repetition introduces yet another time space: the iteration time
space.

<!-- @endif -->

<em>Iteration time space</em> is a time space whose zero time is the
beginning of an animation effect's current iteration.

Within the Web Animations model we also refer to <a>active
time</a> which is a time relative to the beginning of the active
interval.
This time space, however, is internal to the model and not exposed in
the programming interface or in markup.


These time spaces are illustrated below.

<div class="figure">

</div>
<p class="caption">
A comparison of local time, active time, and iteration time for an
animation with a iteration duration of 1s and an iteration count of

</p>

Note: While the time spaces themselves are not bounded, Web
    Animations defines <a>active time</a> and <a>iteration
    time</a> such that they are clamped to a set range as shown in the
    diagram.
    For example, whilst a time of -1 second is a valid time in
    <em>active time space</em>, the procedure for calculating the
    <a>active time</a> defined in <a
    href="#calculating-the-active-time" section></a> will
    never return a negative value.

In addition to these time spaces we can also refer to the
<em>document time space</em> which is time space of the <a>time
values</a> of the <a>default document timeline</a> of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/browsers.html#active-document">active

</div>

<h4 id="interval-timing">Interval timing</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

When an animation effect repeats we must define the behavior at the
iteration boundaries.
For this, and indeed for all interval timing, Web Animations uses an
endpoint-exclusive timing model.
This means that whilst the begin time of an interval
is included in the interval, the end time time is not.
In interval notation this can written <code>[begin, end)</code>.
This model provides sensible behavior when intervals are repeated and
sequenced since there is no overlap between the intervals.


In the examples below, for the repeated effect, at local time 1s,
the iteration time is 0.<!-- @ifndef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
For the sequenced animations, at timeline time 1s, only animation B's
<a>target effect</a> will be <a>in play</a>; there is no overlap.

<!-- @endif -->
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
 For the sequenced effects, at inherited time 1s, only effect B will be
<a>in play</a>; there is no overlap.

<h3 id="animation-effect-speed-control">Animation effect speed control</h3>

Like <a>animations</a>, <a>animation effects</a> also have a <dfn
lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</dfn> parameter.
The <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a> of
an <a>animation effect</a> is a finite real number that acts as
a multiplier when calculating the <a>animation effect</a>'s <a>transformed
time</a> from its <a>local time</a>.

The effect of setting the <a lt="animation effect playback
rate">playback rate</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> differs from the
setting the <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a> on
an animation.
Its behavior is defined in the timing calculations given in
<a href="#core-animation-effect-calculations" section></a>.

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

In summary, the behavior of the <a lt="animation effect playback
rate">playback rate</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> is as follows:

*   The <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback rate</a> is
    applied only to the <a>active interval</a> of an <a>animation
    effect</a> and not to the time while it is <a
    lt="start delay">delayed</a> or <a lt="fill mode">filling</a>.

*   Setting a negative <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback
    rate</a> on an <a>animation effect</a> causes the <a>animation
    effect</a> to begin at the end of its <a>active interval</a>.
    This differs from the <a lt="animation playback rate">playback
    rate</a> on an <a>animation</a>.
    Setting a <a lt="animation playback rate">playback rate</a> on
    an <a>animation</a> to a negative value at a moment before the
    <a>animation</a>'s </a>target effect</a> has begun, will result in the
    <a>target effect</a> never playing.

*   Setting the <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of an <a>animation effect</a> affects the calculated value of
    the <a>active duration</a> (see <a
    href="#calculating-the-active-duration"

At the core of the Web Animations timing model is the process that
takes <!-- @ifndef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
a <a>local time</a> value
<!--@endif -->
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
 an <a>inherited time</a> value
<!--@endif -->
and converts it to an <a>iteration time</a>.
Following this, further transformations are applied before resulting at
a final <a>transformed time</a>.

The first step in this process is to calculate the bounds of the
<a>active interval</a> which is determined by the <a>active
duration</a>.

This process is illustrated below.

<h4 id="scaling-the-time">Scaling the time</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

It is often desirable to control the rate at which an <a>animation
effect</a> progresses.
For example, easing the rate of animation can create a sense of
momentum and produce a more natural effect.
Conversely, in other situations such as when modelling a discrete
change, a smooth transition is undesirable and instead it is necessary
for the <a>animation effect</a> to progress in a series of distinct
steps.

For such situations Web Animations provides <a>timing functions</a>
that scale the progress of an <a>animation effect</a>.

<a>Timing functions</a> take an input progress value and produce
a scaled output progress value.

<h4 id="timing-functions">Timing functions</h4>

A <dfn>timing function</dfn> takes an input progress value in the range

<a>Animation effects</a> have one <a>timing function</a> associated with
them.
The default <a>timing function</a> is the <dfn>linear timing
function</dfn> whose output is identical to its input.
The <a>linear timing function</a> can be represented by the string

The range of timing functions that may be applied to a given
<a>animation effects</a> depends on the type of the <a>animation effects</a>.

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
<div class="issue">
Currently, the set of <a>timing functions</a> allowed on

This has raised concern about complexity of implementation and also

<h4 id="scaling-using-a-cubic-bezier-curve">Scaling using a cubic B&eacute;zier curve</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

A common method of producing easing effects is to use a cubic B&eacute;zier
curve to scale the time.
The endpoints of the curve are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1) while two
control points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> define the shape of
the curve.
Provided the <var>x</var> values of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>
lie within the range [0, 1] such a curve produces a function that is
used to map input times (the <var>x</var> values) onto output times
(the <var>y</var> values).
This arrangement is illustrated below.

<div class="figure">

</div>

A <dfn>cubic B&eacute;zier timing function</dfn> is a type of <a>timing
function</a> defined by four real numbers that specify the two control
points, <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var>, of a cubic B&eacute;zier curve whose
end points are fixed at (0, 0) and (1, 1).
The x coordinates of <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> are
restricted to the range [0, 1].

The evaluation of this curve is covered in many sources such as
[[FUND-COMP-GRAPHICS]].

A <a>cubic B&eacute;zier timing function</a> may be specified as a string
using the following syntax (using notation from [[!CSS3VAL]]):
<blockquote>
  <div
    class="production"><dfn>&lt;cubic-bezier-timing-function&gt;</dfn> =
    ease | ease-in | ease-out | ease-in-out |
    <span class="atom">cubic-bezier(&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;,
      &lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;)</span></div>
</blockquote>

The meaning of each value is as follows:

:   ease
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1).
:   ease-in
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 1, 1).
:   ease-out
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1).
:   ease-in-out
::  Equivalent to cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1).
:   cubic-bezier(&lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;, &lt;number&gt;)
::  Specifies a <a>cubic B&eacute;zier timing function</a>.
    The four numbers specify points <var>P1</var> and <var>P2</var> of
    the curve as (x1, y1, x2, y2).
    Both x values must be in the range [0, 1] or the definition is
    invalid.

<div class="issue">
It has been proposed to extend <code>cubic-bezier</code> to allow
multiple segments, using syntax such as the following:

<pre>
<code>cubic-bezier( [ &lt;number&gt;{6} ; ]* &lt;number&gt;{4} )</code>
</pre>

(i.e. the curve starts at (0, 0); each segment is defined by six
numbers where the start point is the end of the previous segment and
the numbers define the two control points and the end point. The
last segment is defined by four numbers since the end point is fixed
at (1, 1).)

This would provide a simple and compact syntax for tools trying to
map arbitrary curves (e.g. bounce functions) to timing functions.

A <dfn>step timing function</dfn> is a type of <a>timing function</a>
that divides the input time into a specified number of intervals that
are equal in duration.
The output time, starting at zero, rises by an amount equal to the
interval duration once during each interval at the transition point
which may be either the start, midpoint, or end of the interval.

In keeping with Web Animations' model of endpoint exclusive
interval timing (see <a href="#interval-timing"
section></a>), the output time at the transition point is
the time <em>after</em> applying the increase (i.e. the top of the
step) with the following exception.

When a transition point coincides with the end of the <a>active
interval</a> extra care must be taken to produce the correct result
when performing a <a lt="fill mode">fill</a>.
To achieve this, when a <a>step timing function</a> is
applied to an <a>animation effect</a> or applied to an <a>animation
effect</a> associated with an <a>animation effect</a>, an additional
<dfn>before flag</dfn> is passed.
The value of the <a>before flag</a> is determined as follows:


1.  If the <a>active time</a> of the animation effect is
    <a>unresolved</a>, the <a>before flag</a> is not set and these
    steps should be aborted.
2.  Determine the <var>current direction</var> using the procedure
    defined in <a href="#calculating-the-directed-time"
    section></a>.
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_ANIMATION_NODE_PLAYBACKRATE -->
3.  If <em>either</em> the <var>current direction</var> is <span
    class="prop-value">forwards</span> or the <a>animation effect
    playback rate</a> &ge; 0 (but <em>not</em> when both conditions
    are true),
<!-- @endif -->
<!-- @ifndef INCLUDE_ANIMATION_NODE_PLAYBACKRATE -->
3.  If the <var>current direction</var> is <span
    class="prop-value">forwards</span>,
<!-- @endif -->
    let <var>going forwards</var> be true, otherwise it is false.
4.  The <a>before flag</a> is set if the animation effect is in the
    <a>before phase</a> and <var>going forwards</var> is true;
    or if the animation effect is in the <a>after phase</a> and
    <var>going forwards</var> is false.

When a step timing function is evaluated at a transition point, if
the <a>before flag</a> is set the result is the value <em>before</em>
applying the increase.

A <a>step timing function</a> may be specified as a string
using the following syntax:

<blockquote>
  <div class="production"><dfn>&lt;step-timing-function&gt;</dfn> =
    step-start | step-middle | step-end |
    <span class="atom">steps(&lt;integer&gt;[,
                       [ start | middle | end ] ]?)</span></div>
</blockquote>

The meaning of each value is as follows:

:   step-start
::  Equivalent to steps(1, start);
:   step-middle
::  Equivalent to steps(1, middle);
:   step-end
::  Equivalent to steps(1, end);
:   steps(&lt;integer&gt;[, [ start | middle | end ] ]?)
::  Specifies a <a>step timing function</a>.
    The first parameter specifies the number of intervals in the
    function.
    It must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
    The second parameter, which is optional, specifies the point at
    which the change of values occur within the interval.
    If the second parameter is omitted, it is given the value <span
    class="prop-value">end</span>.

<h4 id="calculating-the-transformed-time">Calculating the transformed time</h4>

The <dfn>transformed time</dfn> is calculated from the
<a>directed time</a> using the following steps:

1.  If the <a>directed time</a> is <a>unresolved</a>,
    return an <a>unresolved</a> <a>time value</a>.
2.  If the <a>iteration duration</a> is infinity,
    return the <a>directed time</a>.
3.  Let <var>unscaled progress</var> be the result of
    evaluating <code><a>directed time</a> / <a>iteration
    duration</a></code> unless <a>iteration duration</a> is
    zero, in which case let <var>unscaled progress</var> be
    zero.
4.  Let <var>scaled progress</var> be the result of
    evaluating the <a>animation effect</a>'s <a>timing function</a>
    with <var>unscaled progress</var> as the input progress.
5.  Return the result of evaluating <code><var>scaled
    progress</var> &times; <a>iteration duration</a></code>.
    If the <var>scaled progress</var> is zero, let the result be
    zero.

    Note: This clarification is needed since the <a>iteration duration</a>
        may be infinity and the result of infinity multiplied by zero is
        undefined according to IEEE 754-2008.

<h3 id="grouping-and-synchronization">Grouping and synchronization</h3>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

While it is possible to set the timing properties of <a>animation
effects</a> individually, it is often useful to synchronize <a>animation
effects</a> so that they share common timing properties and maintain
their temporal relationship.  This is achieved using an <a>group
effect</a>.

A simple example is illustrated below.

</div>

A <dfn>group effect</dfn> is a type of <a>animation effect</a> that
contains an ordered sequence of zero or more <a>animation effects</a>
known as <dfn lt="child effect">child effects</dfn>.

At a given moment, an <a>animation effect</a> may be a <a>child effect</a>
of at most one <a>group effect</a> known as the <dfn>parent group</dfn>.
The <a>parent group</a> cannot be the same <a>animation
effect</a> as the <a>child effect</a> itself.

By nesting <a>group effects</a> it is possible to create hierarchical
tree structures.
The following terms are used to describe the parts and properties of
such structures and are defined in [[!DOM]]:

Note: in applying these definitions to <a>animation effects</a>, the
    term <em>parent</em> refers exclusively to a <a>parent group</a> and does
    <em>not</em> include the <a>animation</a> which with
    an <a>animation effect</a> may be <a
    lt="directly associated with an animation">directly associated</a>
    despite the fact that conceptually the <a>animation</a> acts as a parent
    time source.

The temporal relationship between a <a>child effect</a> and its
<a>parent group</a> is incorporated in the definition of
<a>inherited time</a> (see <a href="#local-time-and-inherited-time"
section></a>).

<h4 id="relationship-of-group-time-to-child-time">Relationship of group time to child time</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The timing of the children of a <a>group effect</a> is based on
the timing of the group.
Specifically, times for the children are based on the parent's
<a>transformed time</a>.
With regards to repetition, this means the children operate
<em>inside</em> an iteration of the parent.

For example, if a <a>group effect</a> has an <a>iteration
count</a> of 2, then the children of of the group will all play twice
since they effectively play <em>inside</em> the group's iterations.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-repetition.svg" width="600"
    alt="The effect of multiple iterations on the children of a group.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  Since children of a <a>group effect</a> base their timing on the
  group's <a>transformed time</a>, when the group repeats, the
  children play again.
</p>

Note that even in this case, the child <a>animation effects</a> still
have only <em>one</em> <a>active interval</a>.
However, as a result of the parent's timing, the <a>active
interval</a> is played twice.

If an <a>iteration count</a> is specified for the children of a group
as well as for the group itself, the effect is as if the <a>iteration
count</a> of the group was multiplied with the <a>iteration count</a>
of the children.

  <img src="img/grouping-repetition-and-animation-repetition.svg"

</div>
<p class="caption">
  Specifying an <a>iteration count</a> of 2 on a <a>group effect</a>
  and an <a>iteration count</a> of 3 on one of its children results in
  that child playing 6 times.
</p>

A further result of the children of a <a>group effect</a> basing
their timing on the group's <a>transformed time</a> is that they
cannot animate outside of the group's <a>active interval</a>.
This is because the <a>transformed time</a> of a group will not
change outside its <a>active interval</a>.
This allows groups to <em>clip</em> the playback of their children.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-clipping.svg" width="600"
    alt="Groups clip the active interval of contained children.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
  In the first instance, an <a>animation effect</a> has a negative delay
  and an infinite <a>iteration count</a>.<br>
  However, when a similar <a>animation effect</a> is placed inside
  a <a>group effect</a> with a specified <a>iteration duration</a>
  it has the effect of clipping the child <a>animation effect</a>'s
  <a>active interval</a>.
</p>

Some further consequences of <a>group effect</a> children basing
their timing on their parent group's <a>transformed time</a> are:

<!-- We'd like to conditionally exclude the following point based on

*   Setting the <a lt="animation effect playback rate">playback
    rate</a> of a <a>group effect</a> will speed up or slow down all
    children.

*   Changing the <a>playback direction</a> of a <a>group effect</a>
    will change the direction of all children.

*   Applying a <a>timing function</a> to a <a>group effect</a> will
    affect the progress of all children.

<h4 id="the-start-time-of-children-of-a-group-effect">The start time of
  children of a group effect</h4>

The <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of a <a>child
effect</a> of a <a>group effect</a> is zero.

Note that specific types of <a>group effects</a> may override
this definition to provide other kinds of synchronization behavior.

<h4 id="the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-group-effect">The intrinsic
  iteration duration of a group effect</h4>

The <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> of a <a>group
effect</a> is based on the time when the last <a>child effect</a> completes
its <a>active interval</a> and depends on the
number of <a>child effects</a> as follows.

<div class="switch">

</div>

This definition of the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> may be
overridden by specific types of <a>group effects</a>.

<h4 id="sequence-effects">Sequence effects</h4>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Specific types of <a>group effects</a> can be used to provide
different kinds of synchronization behavior for their children.
This specification defines one additional type of <a>group
effect</a>: a <a>sequence effect</a>.
<a>Sequence effects</a> arrange the start times of their
children so that they run one at a time, in turn.

Compare the two arrangements illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-types.svg" width="600"

<p class="caption">

  (a) is a regular <a>group effect</a> where all the children run
      simultaneously.<br>
  (b) is a <a>sequence effect</a> where the children run in turn.
</p>

Since <a>group effects</a> can also contain other <a>group
effects</a>, complex synchronization is possible by combining
different types of groups as illustrated below.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="img/grouping-nesting.svg" width="600"

  <a>group effect</a> play simultaneously.
  After they have finished the next child of the <a>sequence
  effect</a> plays.
</p>

</div>

A <dfn>sequence effect</dfn> is a type of <a>group effect</a>
that schedules its <a>child effects</a> such that they play in
turn following their order in the group.
This sequencing is achieved by adjusting the <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of each <a>child
effect</a> in the group.

<h5 id="the-start-time-of-children-of-a-sequence-effect">The start time of
  children of a sequence effect</h5>

The <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of
a <a>child effect</a> of a <a>sequence effect</a> is the
<a>end time</a> of the child's <a>previous sibling</a>.
If the child has no <a>previous sibling</a> the start time is zero.

<div class="note">
When the <a>active duration</a> is positive infinity the behavior
for calculating the <a>end time</a> of an <a>animation effect</a>
and the <a lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> of
subsequent children follows the usual behavior defined by IEEE
754-2008.
As a result, if any of the children of a <a>sequence
effect</a> has an infinite <a>active duration</a>, any children
that occur later in the sequence will not play.

Similarly, the above definition does not restrict
<a lt="animation effect start time">start times</a> to positive
values and hence some children may not play due to a negative
<a>start delay</a> on children that occur earlier in the group
since their <a>active interval</a> may end before the group's <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a>.
</div>

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Because the start of the <a>active interval</a> is based on the
sum of an <a>animation effect</a>'s <a
lt="animation effect start time">start time</a> <em>and</em>
<a>start delay</a>, the <a>active intervals</a> of
children of a <a>sequence effect</a> need not run in strict
sequence but can be shifted back and forth by using the <a>start
delay</a> as shown in the following diagram.

A negative <a>start delay</a> can be used to cause the <a>active
interval</a> of two children to overlap.
Note that the <a>start delay</a> affects the <a

children in the group.

<h5 id="the-intrinsic-iteration-duration-of-a-sequence-effect">The intrinsic

<a>child effect</a> appended to the group's children
calculated according to the definition in <a
href="#the-start-time-of-children-of-a-sequence-effect"
section></a> unless that produces a negative value, in
which case the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> is zero.

As a result, if the <a>sequence effect</a> has no <a>child
effects</a> the <a>intrinsic iteration duration</a> will be
zero.
<!-- @endif -->

<h4 id="calculating-the-iteration-progress">Calculating the iteration
  progress</h4>

Before the <a>transformed time</a> is passed to the animation model, it is
normalized to represent a fraction of the <a>iteration duration</a>, known as a
<em>iteration progress</em>.

The <dfn>iteration progress</dfn> of an <a>animation effect</a> is calculated
by running the steps corresponding to the first matching condition from
the following:

    :   Otherwise,
    ::

        1.  Let <var>normalized active duration</var> be the result of
            recalculating the <a>active duration</a> using an

        2.  Return the result of recalculating the <a>transformed

            and an <a>iteration duration</a> of 1.

    </div>

:   Otherwise,
::  Return <a>transformed time</a> / <a>iteration duration</a>.

</div>

Note: Since <a>timing functions</a> are allowed to produce output progress
    values outside the range [0, 1] it is possible that the value calculated
    for the <a>iteration progress</a> also lies outside this range.

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Intuitively, it may seem that the <a>iteration progress</a> for an <a>animation
effect</a> with an <a>iteration duration</a> of zero should be 0 or 1 and that
the above algorithm is unnecessarily complex.
However, the influence of a non-zero <a>iteration start</a>, a non-integral
<a>iteration count</a>, or a <a>playback direction</a> other than forwards can
all cause the <a>animation effect</a> to start and stop mid-way through its
iteration interval.

As a result, it is necessary to perform all the same timing calculations as we
do in the general case including determining the <a>current iteration</a> so
that we arrive at the appropriate <a>directed time</a> when the <a>playback
direction</a> alternates, and applying the <a>timing function</a> to the result
as well.

However, simply substituting the zero <a>iteration duration</a> in to the
procedures defined in <a href="#core-animation-effect-calculations" section></a>
will not produce the desired result since no meaningful value of progress can be
calculated for a zero-duration interval (specifically, the <a>iteration time</a>
will always be zero).

In order to provide the result intuitively expected in this case, the algorithm
above temporarily inflates the <a>iteration duration</a> to 1 and calculates the
<a>iteration progress</a> at the appropriate end of the <a>active interval</a>.

    be identical to <a lt="animation addition">addition</a>.

    A common case where the definitions differ is for list-based
    types where <a lt="animation addition">addition</a> may be
    defined as appending to a list
    whilst <a lt="animation accumulation">accumulation</a> may
    be defined as component-based addition.
    For example, the filter list values "blur(2)" and
    "blur(3)", when <a lt="animation addition">added</a>
    together may produce "blur(2) blur(3)", but when
    <a lt="animation accumulation">accumulated</a>,
    may produce "blur(5)".

<h4 id="specific-animation-behaviors">Specific animation behaviors</h4>

The specific procedures used for animating a given <a>target
property</a> are referred to as the property's <dfn>animation
behavior</dfn>.

The <a>animation behavior</a> of CSS properties is defined by the
"Animatable:" line in the summary of the property's definition or in
[[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] for properties that lack a such a line.

Issue: The default <a>animation behavior</a> for CSS properties is "as
       string".  Should this be defined here or in CSS Animations Level 2?

For DOM attributes, the <a>animation behavior</a> is defined alongside
the attribute definition.
Unlike CSS properties, if such a definition is not provided the
default <a>animation behavior</a> is &ldquo;<a>not animatable</a>&rdquo;.

Following is a series of pre-defined <a>animation behaviors</a>.
[[CSS3-TRANSITIONS]] provides further CSS-specific <a>animation
behaviors</a>.

For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
for <a lt="animation addition">addition</a> or which are defined as
<dfn>not additive</dfn>, the <a
lt="animation addition">addition procedure</a> is simply
<var>V</var><sub>res</sub> = <var>V</var><sub>b</sub>.

For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
for <a lt="animation accumulation">accumulation</a>, the <a
lt="animation accumulation">accumulation procedure</a> is identical
to the <a lt="animation addition">addition procedure</a> for that
behavior.

For <a>animation behaviors</a> that do not define a specific procedure
for <a>distance computation</a> or which are defined as <dfn>not
paceable</dfn>, the <a>distance computation</a> procedure is simply
<var>distance</var> = 1.

<h5 id="not-animatable-section">Not animatable</h5>

Some properties are specifically defined as <dfn
id="concept-not-animatable">not animatable</dfn>.
For example, properties defining animation parameters are <a>not animatable</a>
since doing so would create complex recursive behavior.

Unlike other <a>animation behaviors</a>, no procedures for
<a lt="animation interpolation">interpolation</a>,
<a lt="animation addition">addition</a> and <a>distance
computation</a> are defined for properties whose <a>animation
behavior</a> is <a>not animatable</a> since these
properties should not be modified.

An <a>animation effect</a> that targets a property that is
<a>not animatable</a> will still exhibit the
usual behavior for an <a>animation effect</a> such as
<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
occupying time in a <a>sequence effect</a> and
<!-- @endif -->
delaying the fulfilment of an <a>animation</a>'s <a>current finished promise</a>.

<h5 id="animatable-as-string-section">Animatable as string</h5>

A <a>target property</a> that is <dfn>animatable as string</dfn>

A <a>target property</a> that is <dfn>animatable as length,

*   <a>distance computation</a>: as with <a>animatable as real

    value</a> [[!CSS21]] for <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and
    <var>V</var><sub>end</sub>.

    When there is insufficient context to calculate a used value for all
    possible values of <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and
    <var>V</var><sub>end</sub>, the result of the <a>distance computation</a>
    calculation is 1 (i.e. the behavior degenerates to <a>not paceable</a>).

    <div class="example">
      For example, for a <a>keyframe effect</a> that does not have
      an <a>target element</a>, there is no containing block for resolving
      percentage values against.
      As a result, the following code snippet falls back to <a>not paceable</a>
      <a>animation behavior</a>.

      <pre class='lang-javascript'>

// Prints '0, 0.5, 1'
effect.getFrames().map(frame =&gt; frame.computedOffset).join(', ');
      </pre>

      For consistency, this definition applies even when a used value
      could be calculated for each of the animation values in question.
      As such, the following code fragment produces the same result.

      <pre class='lang-javascript'>
var effect =

                       { top: '20px' },

<div class="issue">

    For <a>distance computation</a> we previously defined it as follows:

    4.  If both are rotate &rarr; absolute difference
    5.  If both match but are something else &rarr; use linear
    6.  If they don't match &rarr; use matrix decomposition and
        euclidean distance between translate components

    This seems really arbitrary, especially part 5.

    Also, looking at only the first component seems odd.
    Going through each component, working out the distance and then
    getting the square of the distance also seems much more consistent
    with what we do elsewhere.

<h5 id="other-animation-behaviors">Other animation behaviors</h5>

The set of <a>animation behaviors</a> defined here may be extended

href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-images-3/#interpolation">CSS Image
Values and Replaced Content</a>
[[CSS4-IMAGES]].

<div class="issue">

    There are a bunch of CSS properties for which distance (and in
    some cases addition) is not defined or which need special
    handling.

    For example,

    *   font-stretch (an enum but handled like an integer)
    *   visibility (0 or 1 depending on if endpoints match or not)
    *   flex-grow and flex-shrink which allow animation only if one of
        the endpoints is 0)
    *   value pairs, triples (use square distance)
    *   rects (use square distance)
    *   dash arrays (square distance but a bit weird due to
        percentages)
    *   shadows (square distance of components)
    *   filters (undefined)
    *   background-position (special list handling needed)
    *   pair lists

    Should we define these here or in the CSS Animation 2 spec?

</div>

<h4 id="effect-values">Effect values</h4>

Given an <a>iteration progress</a>, a <a>current iteration</a>, and an
<a>underlying value</a>, a <a>keyframe effect</a> produces
an <dfn>effect value</dfn> for each <a>animatable</a> <a>target property</a>
by applying the <a>animation behavior</a> appropriate to the property.

<h3 id="keyframes-section">Keyframes</h3>

The <a>effect values</a> for a <a>keyframe effect</a>
are calculated by interpolating between a series of property values
positioned at fractional offsets.
Each set of property values indexed by an offset is called
a <dfn>keyframe</dfn>.

The <dfn lt="keyframe offset">offset of a keyframe</dfn> is a value
in the range [0, 1] or the special value null.
The list of <a>keyframes</a> for a <a>keyframe effect</a> is
<dfn>loosely sorted by offset</dfn> which means that for each
<a>keyframe</a> in the list that has a <a>keyframe offset</a> that is
not null, the offset is greater than or equal to the offset of the
previous <a>keyframe</a> in the list with a <a>keyframe offset</a> that
is not null, if any.

The behavior when <a>keyframes</a> overlap or have unsupported values
is defined in <a
href="#the-effect-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect"
section></a>.

Each keyframe also has a <a>timing function</a> associated with it
that is applied to the period of time between the keyframe on which it
is specified and the <em>next</em> keyframe in the list.
The <a>timing function</a> specified on the last keyframe in the
list is never applied.

Each <a>keyframe</a> may also have a <dfn>keyframe-specific composite
operation</dfn> that is applied to all values
specified in that <a>keyframe</a>.
The possible operations and their meanings are identical to those defined
for the <a>composite operation</a> associated with the <a>keyframe effect</a>
as a whole in <a href="#effect-composition" section></a>.
If no <a>keyframe-specific composite operation</a> is specified for
a <a>keyframe</a>, the <a>composite operation</a> specified for the
<a>keyframe effect</a> as a whole is used for values specified in that keyframe.

<h4 id="spacing-keyframes">Spacing keyframes</h4>
<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

It is often useful to be able to provide a series of property values
without having calculate the <a>keyframe offset</a> of each value in
time but instead to rely on some automatic spacing.

For example, rather than typing:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue', offset: 0 },
               { color: 'green', offset: 1/3 },
               { color: 'red', offset: 2/3 },
               { color: 'yellow', offset: 1 } ], 2000);</pre>

It should be possible to type the following and allow the user agent
to calculate the <a lt="keyframe offset">offset</a> of each
keyframe:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue' },
               { color: 'green' },
               { color: 'red' },
               { color: 'yellow' } ], 2000);</pre>

Web Animations provides spacing modes for this purpose. The default
spacing mode for keyframe effects is
&ldquo;<a
lt="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</a>&rdquo; which
produces the result described above.

The other spacing mode, &ldquo;<a
lt="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>&rdquo;, is useful when
it is desirable to maintain an even rate of change such as for motion path
animation.

For example, consider the following animation:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
elem.animate([ { left: '0px' },
               { left: '-20px' },
               { left: '100px' },
               { left: '50px' } ], 1000);</pre>

The resulting value of the <span class="prop-name">left</span>
property is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/spacing-distribute.svg" width="350"
     alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the distribute spacing mode.
The values are evenly spaced in time but the rate of change differs for each segment as indicated the varying slope of the graph.">
</div>
<p class="caption">

<a lt="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</a> spacing
mode.
The values are evenly spaced in time but the rate of change differs
for each segment as indicated the varying slope of the graph.
</p>

We can use the <a lt="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>
spacing mode as follows:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
elem.animate([ { left: '0px' },
               { left: '-20px' },
               { left: '100px' },
               { left: '50px' } ],
             { duration: 1000, spacing: "paced(left)" });</pre>

The result is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/spacing-paced.svg" width="350"
     alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the paced spacing mode.
The absolute value of the slope is graph is equal for all segments of the animation indicating a constant rate of change.">
</div>
<p class="caption">
The animated value of the left property over time when applying the
<a lt="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a> spacing mode.
The absolute value of the slope is graph is equal for all segments
of the animation indicating a constant rate of change.
</p>

It is also possible to combine fixed <a>keyframe offsets</a> with
spacing modes as follows:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
elem.animate([ { left: '0px' },
               { left: '-20px' },
               { left: '100px', offset: 0.5 },
               { left: '50px' } ],
             { duration: 1000, spacing: "paced(left)" });</pre>

The result is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/spacing-paced-with-offset.svg" width="350"
     alt="The animated value of the left property over time when applying the paced spacing mode and a fixed offset that puts the 100px value at 0.5.

Before calculating effect values from a <a>keyframe effect</a>,
an absolute value must be computed for <a>keyframe offset</a>
of each <a>keyframe</a> with a null offset.

The values computed depend on the <dfn>keyframe spacing mode</dfn>
specified for the <a>keyframe effect</a>.
The keyframe spacing modes are:

:   <dfn lt="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</dfn></dt>
::  Indicates that <a>keyframes</a> with a null <a>keyframe offset</a>
    are positioned so that the difference between subsequent
    <a>keyframe offsets</a> are equal.
:   <dfn lt="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</dfn></dt>
::  Indicates that <a>keyframes</a> with a null <a>keyframe offset</a>
    are positioned so that the <em>distance</em> between subsequent
    values of a specified <dfn>paced property</dfn> are equal.
    The distance is calculated using the <a>distance computation</a>
    procedure defined by the <a>animation behavior</a> associated
    with the <a>paced property</a>.

Since the absolute value calculated for a <a>keyframe offset</a> may change
depending on the keyframe values, the number of values, or external context
(such as when using <a>paced keyframe spacing mode</a> in combination with
percentage values or em-based units), the original null values are not
overwritten, rather, the calculated absolute values are stored as a separate
value on each keyframe known as its <dfn>computed keyframe offset</dfn>.

<h5 id="applying-spacing-to-keyframes">Applying spacing to keyframes</h5>

We define a generic procedure for <dfn>evenly distributing
a keyframe</dfn>, <var>keyframe</var>, between two reference
keyframes, <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>, whose <a>computed keyframe
offsets</a> are <em>not</em> null, as follows:

1.  Let <dfn>offset<sub><var>k</var></sub></dfn> be the <a>computed
    keyframe offset</a> of a <a>keyframe</a> <var>k</var>.
1.  Let <var>n</var> be the number of keyframes <em>between</em> and
    including <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> minus 1.
1.  Let <var>index</var> refer to the position of
    <var>keyframe</var> in the sequence of keyframes between
    <var>start</var> and <var>end</var> such that the first keyframe
    after <var>start</var> has an <var>index</var> of 1.
1.  Set the <a>computed keyframe offset</a> of <var>keyframe</var> to
    <a lt="offsetk">offset</a><sub><var>start</var></sub> +
    (<a lt="offsetk">offset</a><sub><var>end</var></sub> &minus;
     <a lt="offsetk">offset</a><sub><var>start</var></sub>)
    &times; <var>index</var> / <var>n</var>.

The <a>computed keyframe offset</a> values of each <a>keyframe</a>
are determined using the following procedure.

1.  Let <var>keyframes</var> refer to the list of <a>keyframes</a>
    associated with the <a>keyframe effect</a>.
1.  For each <a>keyframe</a>, in <var>keyframes</var>,
    let the <a>computed keyframe offset</a> of the <a>keyframe</a>
    be equal to its <a>keyframe offset</a> value.
1.  If <var>keyframes</var> contains more than one
    <a>keyframe</a> and the <a>computed keyframe offset</a> of
    the first <a>keyframe</a> in <var>keyframes</var> is null,
    set the <a>computed keyframe offset</a> of
    the first <a>keyframe</a> to 0.
1.  If the <a>computed keyframe offset</a> of the last <a>keyframe</a> in
    <var>keyframes</var> is null, set its
    <a>computed keyframe offset</a> to 1.
1.  For each pair of <a>keyframes</a> <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>
    where:

    *   <var>A</var> appears before <var>B</var> in
        <var>keyframes</var>, and
    *   <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have a <a>computed keyframe
        offset</a> that is not null, and
    *   all <a>keyframes</a> between <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>
        have a null <a>computed keyframe offset</a>,

    calculate the <a>computed keyframe offset</a> of
    each <a>keyframe</a> between <var>A</var> and <var>B</var>
    depending on the <a>keyframe spacing mode</a> as follows:

    <div class="switch">

    :   If the <a lt="keyframe spacing mode">spacing mode</a>
        is <a lt="paced keyframe spacing mode">paced</a>,</dt>
    ::

        1.  Define a keyframe as <dfn>paceable</dfn> if it
            contains a value for the <a>paced property</a>.
        1.  Let <var>paced A</var> be the first keyframe in the
            range [<var>A</var>, <var>B</var>] that is
            <a>paceable</a>, if any.
        1.  Let <var>paced B</var> be the last keyframe in the
            range [<var>A</var>, <var>B</var>] that is
            <a>paceable</a>, if any.
        1.  If there is no <var>paced A</var> or <var>paced
            B</var> let both refer to <var>B</var>.

            Note: In this case the spacing behavior degenerates to <a
            lt="distribute keyframe spacing mode">distribute</a> spacing.

        1.  For each keyframe in the range
            (<var>A</var>, <var>paced A</var>] and
            [<var>paced B</var>, <var>B</var>),

Issue: The above algorithm is quite complex.
    It attempts to cover all possible combinations of input where
    keyframe offsets and or paced property values may be missing.
    Furthermore, it attempts to do this in a way that degenerates
    consistently and also allows the author to combine fixed offsets
    with either pacing or distribute spacing.
    We await implementation experience to determine if the complexity
    is justified.

<h4 id="the-effect-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect">The effect value of a keyframe effect</h4>

The <a>effect value</a> of a single property

1.  Let <var>target property</var> be the property for which the

2.  If <a>animation behavior</a> of the <var>target property</var> is
    <a>not animatable</a> abort this procedure
    since the effect cannot be applied.
3.  Define the <dfn>neutral value for composition</dfn> as a value
    which, when combined with an <a>underlying value</a> using the <a

    operation</a>, produces the <a>underlying value</a>.
4.  Let <var>property-specific keyframes</var> be a copy of the list

5.  Remove any <a>keyframes</a> from <var>property-specific

7.  If there is no <a>keyframe</a> in <var>property-specific

11. For each <var>keyframe</var> in <var>interval endpoints</var>:

        perform the following steps:

        1.  Let <var>composite operation to use</var> be the
            <a>composite operation</a> of <var>keyframe</var>, or if
            it has none, the <a>composite operation</a> of this
            <a>keyframe effect</a>.
        2.  Let <var>value to combine</var> be the property value of
            <var>target property</var> specified on

        3.  Replace the property value of <var>target property</var>
            on <var>keyframe</var> with the result of combining
            <var>underlying value</var> (<var>V</var><sub>a</sub>) and

        apply the following step <var>current iteration</var> times:

        *   replace the property value of <var>target property</var>
            on <var>keyframe</var> with the result of combining the
            property value (<var>V</var><sub>a</sub>) with the
            property value on the final keyframe in
            <var>property-specific keyframes</var>

        Issue: It seems like this could be done as a separate step at the end

12. If there is only one keyframe in <var>interval endpoints</var>
    return the property value of <var>target property</var> on that

15. Let <var>interval distance</var> be the result of evaluating
    <code>(<var>iteration progress</var> - <var>start offset</var>) /
    (<var>end offset</var> - <var>start offset</var>)</code>
16. Return the result of applying the <a

    by the <a>animation behavior</a> of the <var>target property</var>,
    to the values of the <var>target property</var> specified on the
    two keyframes in <var>interval endpoints</var> taking the first such
    value as <var>V</var><sub>start</sub> and the second as
    <var>V</var><sub>end</sub> and using <var>interval
    distance</var> as the interpolation parameter <var>p</var>.

<div class="note">

    Note that this procedure assumes the following about the list of
    <a>keyframes</a> specified on the effect:</p>

    *   Each <a>keyframe</a> has a specified <a>computed keyframe offset</a> in
        the range [0, 1].
    *   The list of <a>keyframes</a> is sorted in ascending order by
        <a>computed keyframe offset</a>.
    *   Each specified property value is a valid and supported value.
    *   For a given property, there is at most one specified property
        value on each keyframe.

    It is the responsibility of the user of the model (for example,
    a declarative markup or programming interface) to ensure these
    conditions are met.

    For example, for the <a href="#programming-interface">programming
    interface</a> defined by this specification, these conditions are
    met by applying the normalization defined in <a
    href="#processing-a-frames-argument" section></a>
    and resolving null <a>keyframe offsets</a> by
    applying <a href="#spacing-keyframes">spacing behavior</a>.

</div>

Note: this procedure permits overlapping <a>keyframes</a>.
    The behavior is that at the point of overlap the output value jumps to
    the value of the last defined <a>keyframe</a> at that offset.
    For overlapping frames at 0 or 1, the output value for <a>iteration
    progress</a> values less than 0 or greater than
    or equal to 1 is the value of the first <a>keyframe</a> or the last
    <a>keyframe</a> in <var>keyframes</var> respectively.

<div class="issue">
    In the presence of certain timing functions, the input iteration
    progress to an animation effect is not limited to the range [0, 1].
    Currently, however, keyframe offsets <em>are</em> limited to the
    range [0, 1] and property values are simply extrapolated for input
    iteration progress values outside this range.

    We have considered removing this restriction since some cases exist
    where it is useful to be able to specify non-linear
    changes in property values at iteration progress values outside the
    range [0, 1].
    One example is an animation that interpolates from green to yellow
    but has an overshoot timing function that makes it temporarily
    interpolate &lsquo;beyond&rsquo; yellow to red before settling back
    to yellow.

    While this effect could be achieved by modification of the keyframes
    and timing function, this approach seems to break the model's
    separation of timing concerns from animation effects.

    It is not clear how this effect should be achieved but we note that
    allowing keyframe offsets outside [0, 1] may make the currently
    specified behavior where keyframes at offset 0 and 1 are synthesized
    as necessary, inconsistent.

<h3 id="combining-effects">Combining effects</h3>
<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

After calculating the <a>effect values</a> for a
<a>keyframe effect</a>, they are applied to the <a>animation
effect</a>'s <a lt="target property">target properties</a>.

Since it is possible for multiple <a>in effect</a> <a>keyframe effects</a> to
target the same property it is often necessary to combine the results of several
<a>keyframe effects</a> together.
This process is called <dfn lt='composition'>compositing</dfn> and is
based on establishing an <a>effect stack</a> for each property
targetted by an <a>in effect</a> <a>animation effect</a>.

After compositing the results of <a>keyframe
effects</a> together, the composited result is combined with other
values specified for the <a>target property</a>.

For a CSS <a>target property</a> the arrangement is illustrated below:

<div class="figure">
<img src="img/animation-cascade.svg" width="500"
alt="Overview of the application of effect values
to their target properties">
</div>
<p class="caption">
Overview of the application of <a>effect values</a> to
their <a>target properties</a>.<br>
The results of <a>keyframe effects</a> targetting the same property
are composited together using an <a>effect stack</a>.<br>
The result of this composition is then inserted into the CSS cascade
at an appropriate point.
</p>

For a <a>target property</a> that specifies a DOM attribute, the
composited result is combined with the value of the attribute
specified in the DOM or the lacuna value for that attribute if it is
not specified.

For the first part of this operation&mdash;combining <a>effect values</a> that
target the same <a lt="target property">property</a>&mdash; it is necessary to
determine both
<em>how</em> <a>keyframe effects</a>
are combined with one another,
as well as the <em>order</em> in which they are applied, that is,
their relative <em>priority</em>.

The matter of <em>how</em> <a>effect values</a> are
combined is governed by the <a>composite operation</a> of
the corresponding <a>keyframe effects</a>.

The relative <em>priority</em> of <a>effect values</a>
is determined by an <a>effect stack</a> established for each
animated property.
</div>

<h4 id="animation-types">Animation types</h4>

This specification provides a common animation model intended to be used
by other specifications that define markup or programming interfaces on
top of this model. The particular markup or programming interface that
generated an <a>animation</a> defines its <dfn>animation type</dfn>.

Further specifications may define specialized behavior for prioritizing
animations between types or within a particular type.

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

For example, animations whose <a lt="animation type">type</a> is &lsquo;CSS
animation&rsquo; are defined as having a <em>higher</em> priority than
animations whose type is &lsquo;CSS transition&rsquo; but <em>lower</em> than
other animations without a specific type.

Within the set of &lsquo;CSS animation&rsquo; objects, specialized
prioritization is defined based on the <code>animation-name</code> property
amongst other factors.

</div>

<h4 id="the-effect-stack">The effect stack</h4>

Associated with each property <a lt="target property">targetted</a>
by one or more <a>keyframe effects</a> is an <dfn>effect
stack</dfn> that establishes the relative priority of the <a>keyframe
effects</a>.

The relative priority of any two <a>keyframe effects</a>,
<var>A</var> and <var>B</var>, within an <a>effect stack</a> is
established by comparing their properties as follows:

1.  Let the <dfn>associated animation of an animation effect</dfn>
    be the <a>animation</a> <a
    lt="associated with an animation">associated</a> with the
    <a>animation effect</a> that affecting the property with which this
    <a>effect stack</a> is associated.

        associated animations.
    1.  If <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> are still not sorted,

<h4 id="calculating-the-result-of-an-effect-stack">Calculating the result of an effect stack</h4>

In order to calculate the final value of an <a>effect stack</a>,
the <a>effect values</a> of each
<a>keyframe effect</a> in the stack are combined in order of priority
from lowest to highest priority.

Each step in the process of evaluating an <a>effect stack</a> takes
an <dfn>underlying value</dfn> as input.

For each <a>keyframe effect</a> in the stack, the appropriate
<a>effect value</a> from the <a>keyframe effect</a>
is combined with the <a>underlying value</a> to produce a new value.
This resulting value becomes the <a>underlying value</a> for combining
the next <a>keyframe effect</a> in the stack.

The final value of an <a>effect stack</a>, called the
<dfn>composited value</dfn>, is simply the result of combining the
<a>effect value</a> of the final (highest priority)
<a>keyframe effect</a> in the stack with the <a>underlying value</a>
at that point.

<h4 id="effect-composition">Effect composition</h4>

The specific operation used to combine an <a>effect value</a> with an
<a>underlying value</a> is determined by the
<dfn>composite operation</dfn> of the <a>keyframe effect</a> that
produced the <a>effect value</a>.

This specification defines three <a>composite operations</a> as
follows:

:   <dfn lt="composite operation replace">replace</dfn>
::  The result of compositing the <a>effect value</a>
    with the <a>underlying value</a> is simply the <a>effect value</a>.
:   <dfn lt="composite operation add">add</dfn>
::  The <a>effect value</a> is <a
    lt="animation addition">added</a> to the <a>underlying
    value</a>.
    For <a>animation behaviors</a> where the
    <a lt="animation addition">addition operation</a> is defined
    such that it is not commutative, the order of the operands is
    <code><a>underlying value</a> + <a>effect value</a></code>.
:   <dfn lt="composite operation accumulate">accumulate</dfn></dt>
::  The <a>effect value</a> is <a
    lt="animation accumulation">accumulated</a>
    onto the <a>underlying value</a>.
    For <a>animation behaviors</a> where the
    <a lt="animation accumulation">accumulation operation</a> is
    defined such that it is not commutative, the order of the operands
    is <a>underlying value</a> followed by <a>effect value</a>.

<h4 id="applying-the-composited-result">Applying the composited result</h4>

The process for applying a <a>composited value</a> depends on if the
<a>target property</a> refers to a CSS property or a DOM attribute.

<h5 id="applying-the-result-to-a-css-property">Applying the composited result to a CSS property</h5>

Applying a <a>composited value</a> to a CSS <a>target property</a>
is achieved by adding a specified value to the CSS cascade.

The level of the cascade to which this specified value is added
depends on the <a lt="animation type">type</a> of the <a>animation</a> <a
lt="associated animation of an animation effect">associated with</a> the
highest priority effect in the <a>effect stack</a> for a given property.
By default, the specified value is added to the &lsquo;Animation
declarations&rsquo; level of the cascade ([[!css-cascade-3]]).

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

For example, if the highest priority effect is associated with a
&lsquo;CSS transition&rsquo;-type animation, the <a>composited value</a>
will be added to &lsquo;Transition declarations&rsquo; level of the cascade.

</div>

The <a>composited value</a> calculated for a CSS <a>target
property</a> is applied using the following process.

1.  Calculate the <var>base value</var> of the property as
    the value generated for that property by computing the computed value
    for that property in the absence of animations.
2.  Establish the <a>effect stack</a> for the property (see <a
    href="#the-effect-stack" section></a>).
3.  Calculate the <a>composited value</a> of the <a>effect
    stack</a> passing in the <var>base value</var> of the property
    as the initial <a>underlying value</a> (see <a
    href="#calculating-the-result-of-an-effect-stack"
    section></a>).
4.  Insert the <a>composited value</a> into the CSS cascade at the
    level defined for the <a lt="animation type">type</a> of the
    <a>animation</a> <a
    lt="associated animation of an animation effect">associated with</a> the
    effect at the top of the <a>effect stack</a> established for the target
    property.

<h5 id="applying-the-composited-result-to-a-dom-attribute">Applying the composited result to a DOM attribute</h5>

DOM attributes are, unless otherwise specified, <a>not animatable</a>.
For each attribute that has a specific <a>animation behavior</a>
associated with it, an attribute value to use when the attribute is
not specified or in error must be defined, referred to as the
<dfn>lacuna value</dfn>.
For example, SVG2 ([[SVG2]]) defines <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG2/intro.html#TermLacunaValue">lacunae
values</a> for its attributes.

The <a>composited value</a> calculated for a DOM attribute <a>target
property</a> is applied using the following process.

1.  Let the <var>base value</var> of the property be the value
    specified for attribute in the DOM or,
    if the attribute value is not specified in the DOM, the
    <a>lacuna value</a> for that attribute.
2.  Establish the <a>effect stack</a> for the property (see <a
    href="#the-effect-stack" section></a>).</li>
3.  Calculate the <a>composited value</a> of the <a>effect
    stack</a> passing in the <var>base value</var> of the attribute
    as the initial <a>underlying value</a> (see <a
    href="#calculating-the-result-of-an-effect-stack"
    section></a>).</li>
4.  Record the <a>composited value</a> as the <dfn>animated
    attribute value</dfn> of the attribute.

The <a>animated attribute value</a> does not replace the value of
the attribute in the DOM although it may be accessible via some
other interface.
For all intents and purposes other than querying attributes values
using DOM interfaces, user agents must treat the <a>animated attribute
value</a> as the attribute value.

<h4 id="effect-accumulation-section">Effect accumulation</h4>

Similar to the compositing performed between <a>effect values</a>
(see <a href="#effect-composition"
section></a>), the <dfn>iteration composite operation</dfn>
determines how values are combined between successive iterations of
the same <a>keyframe effect</a>.

This specification defines two <a>iteration composite operations</a>
as follows:

:   <dfn lt="iteration composite operation replace">replace</dfn>
::  Each successive iteration is calculated independently of previous
    iterations.
:   <dfn lt="iteration composite operation accumulate">accumulate
::  Successive iterations of the animation are <a
    lt="animation accumulation">accumulated</a> with the
    final value of the previous iteration.

    The application of the <a>iteration composite operation</a> is
    incorporated in the calculation of the <a>effect value</a> in <a
    href="#the-effect-value-of-a-keyframe-animation-effect"
    section></a>.

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_CUSTOM_EFFECTS -->
<h3 id="custom-effects">Custom effects</h3>

Issue: This whole feature needs to be revisited. The current thinking is that
       rather than having custom effects, we should simply have an
       <code>onsample</code> callback on each <a>animation effect</a>.  That
       would allow, for example, augmenting an existing effect with a function
       that performs logging or triggers additional actions at certain times.
       With the current arrangement, doing this would require adding a parent
       group just to achieve this.

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

In some situations the <a>animation
effects</a> provided by Web Animations may be insufficient.
For example, the <a>animation effects</a>
defined here are only able to target certain CSS properties.
They are unable, therefore, to modify the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/struct.html#__svg__SVGSVGElement__currentScale"><code>currentScale</code></a>
property of an SVG element to smoothly zoom the viewport without
affecting the document content.

In such cases, where the provided <a>animation
effects</a> do not provide needed functionality, an effect defined by
script may be used.
Such <a>custom effects</a> receive an <a>iteration
progress</a> and <a>current iteration</a> from the timing model and
are responsible for producing an effect corresponding to the specified
time.

Using an effect defined in script it is possible to animate not only
otherwise un-animatable attributes and properties, but potentially
anything that is accessible via script, including even producing audio
or creating vibrations.

For example, using a <a>custom effect</a> that draws to a <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/scripting-1.html#the-canvas-element"><code>canvas</code></a>
element, it is possible to produce a complex animated effect
featuring patterns that may be difficult to create using CSS or
SVG.
Compared to using <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/animation-timing/">Timing control for
script-based animations</a>,
this approach ensures the animation is frame-rate
independent and can be paused, reversed, eased with timing effects,
accelerated, synchronized with other animations, and be controlled
in the same manner as any other Web Animations animation without any
additional programming.

</div>

A <dfn>custom effect</dfn> is an author-defined programming callback
that is passed timing information when <a>sampling</a> is performed.

<h4 id="sampling-custom-effects">Sampling custom effects</h4>

<a>Custom effects</a> are called for each referencing <a>animation effect</a>
when a <a lt='single-sample'>sample</a> is performed based on the 
following criteria.

1.  If, on the previous sample, the <a>animation effect</a>
    referencing the <a>custom effect</a>:

    *   was <a>in effect</a>, and
    *   referenced this same <a>custom effect</a>, and
    *   had a different <a>target element</a>

    Call the callback passing an <a>unresolved</a> <a>iteration progress</a>
    and the <a>target element</a> from the previous sample as parameters to
    the callback.
2.  Call the callback for the current <a>target element</a> based on
    the first matching condition from the following:

    <div class="switch">

    :   If the <a>animation effect</a> referencing the custom
        effect is not <a>in effect</a> but was <a>in effect</a> in the previous
        sample,
    ::  Call the callback passing an <a>unresolved</a> <a>iteration progress</a>
        and the current <a>target element</a> as parameters to the callback.
    :   Otherwise, if the <a>animation effect</a> referencing
        the custom effect:
    ::

        *   <strong>is <a>in effect</a>, and</strong>
        *   <strong>was not <a>in effect</a> in the previous 
            <a lt='single-sample'>sample</a>, or
              was <a>in effect</a> but with a different <a>iteration
              progress</a> or <a>current iteration</a>,</strong>

    ::  Call the callback passing with the referencing
        <a>animation effect</a>'s current <a>iteration
        progress</a> and <a>target element</a> as parameters to the callback.

    </div>

<div class="issue">
There may be use cases where an action needs to be triggered at
a specific point in an animation tree.
In many cases this can be achieved by inserting a custom effect with
a step-start easing that spans the period during which the action
should be triggered.
However, this can impose additional layout requirements on the
content which might be cumbersome to accomodate.

Some alternatives under consideration:

*   Additional calling conditions could be defined to accommodate
    zero-width custom effects. For example, it could be required
    that the callback be called if (given infinite precision) there
    was a time between the previous and current sample times that
    aligned with the custom effect.
*   Instead of adding special calling conditions to custom effects,
    a new type of animation effect, Trigger, could be introduced. The
    trigger would only ever act as a zero-width custom effect as
    described above, its constructor would take a callback function,
    but not require a target or timing. It could also specify other
    calling conventions, for example whether it should only trigger
    in a specific playback direction.

</div>

<h4 id="execution-order-of-custom-effects">Execution order of custom effects</h4>

Since <a>custom effects</a>, unlike <a
lt="animation effect">animation effects</a>, are not limited to
a single <a>target property</a>, the steps for assessing their
order of execution differs from <a>animation effects</a>.f

<a>Custom effects</a> are executed after all
<a>animation effects</a> have completed and
applied their result to their targets (see <a
href="#applying-the-composited-result" section></a>).

Issue: Need to define this more precisely.
    Are styles flushed?
    Presumably they are.
    Can we suspend reflow for the duration of executing the script-based
    animation effects and just do it once afterwards?

Within the set of <a>custom effects</a>, the
order of execution is the same as that defined for <a>animation effects</a> in
<a href="#the-effect-stack" section></a>.
Items sorted earlier are executed before those sorted later.

<p>The <var>timing</var> parameter passed to the {{GroupEffectReadOnly()}},

constructor may be an {{AnimationEffectTimingProperties}} object, a double
representing the duration of the <a>animation effect</a> in milliseconds, or

<var>timing</var>, normalizes the above inputs into

    :   Otherwise (<var>timing</var> is undefined),
    ::  Return a new {{AnimationEffectTimingProperties}} object with all members set
        to their default values.

<div class="note">

Note that since {{AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly}} objects have the same
member keys as {{AnimationEffectTimingProperties}} dictionaries, it is
also possible to pass the {{AnimationEffectReadOnly/timing}} member of another
{{AnimationEffectReadOnly}} to the any of the methods that invoke this method
as the <var>timing</var> parameter.

Doing so will cause the {{AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly}} object to be
treated as an {{AnimationEffectTimingProperties}} dictionary and thus it
will effectively be cloned, not shared.

<div class="example">

For example, the timing of two animations may be aligned as follows:

<pre class="lang-javascript">
var effectA = elem.animate({ opacity: 0 }, 1000).effect;
var effectB = elem.animate({ width: '0px' }, effectA.timing).effect;
alert(effectA.timing !== effectB.timing); // Displays 'true'

<h4 id="creating-a-new-keyframeeffect-object">Creating a new <code>KeyframeEffect</code> object</h4>

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative</em>

The {{KeyframeEffectReadOnly()}} and {{KeyframeEffect()}} constructors offer
a number of approaches to creating a new {{KeyframeEffectReadOnly}} and
{{KeyframeEffect}} objects.

At its simplest, an {{KeyframeEffect}} object that changes the
&lsquo;left&rsquo; property of <var>elem</var> to 100px over three
seconds can be constructed as follows:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
var effect = new KeyframeEffect(elem, { left: '100px' }, 3000);</pre>

The second parameter, representing the list of keyframes, may
specify multiple properties.

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// Specify multiple properties at once
var effectA = new KeyframeEffect(elem, { left: '100px', top: '300px' }, 3000);

// Specify multiple frames
var effectB = new KeyframeEffect(elem, [ { left: '100px' }, { left: '300px' } ], 3000);</pre>

The third parameter, representing the animation's timing, may
simply be a number representing the <a>iteration duration</a> in
milliseconds as above, or, to specify further timing properties such
as the <a>start delay</a>, an {{AnimationEffectTimingProperties}} object can
be used, as follows:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
var effect =
  new KeyframeEffect(elem, { left: '100px' }, { duration: 3000, delay: 2000 });</pre>

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
If the duration is not specified, the <a>intrinsic iteration
duration</a> is used which, for a <a>keyframe effect</a>, is zero.
<!-- @endif -->
<!-- @ifndef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
If the duration is not specified, a value of zero is used.
<!-- @endif -->
It is possible to create an animation that simply sets a property
without any interpolation as follows:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
var effect = new KeyframeEffect(elem, { display: 'none' }, { fill: 'forwards' });</pre>


<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
This is particularly useful in combination with other <a>animation effects</a>.
For example, fading an element before switching
&lsquo;display&rsquo; to &lsquo;none&rsquo; can be achieved as
follows,

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
new SequenceEffect(
  [
    new KeyframeEffect(elem, { opacity: 0 }, 1000),
    new KeyframeEffect(elem, { display: 'none' }, { fill: 'forwards' })
  ]
);</pre>
<!-- @endif -->

Having created a {{KeyframeEffect}}, it can be played by adding it to
an {{Animation}} and then playing that animation.
For simple effects, however, the <a
href="#extensions-to-the-element-interface"><code>Element.animate</code></a>
shortcut is more convenient since it performs these steps
automatically. For example,

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
elem.animate({ left: '100px' }, 3000);</pre>

<div class="note">

Since accessing the properties of an ECMAScript user object can
have side effects, the manner in which these properties is
accessed is important.
In light of this consideration the procedure for converting an
ECMAScript object into an IDL {{Keyframe}} object has the following
properties:

*   Each property that is read, is read only once.
*   Properties are read in a well-defined order.
*   Properties corresponding to unsupported target properties or
    attributes are not read.

</div>

Since much of the processing for {{Keyframe}} objects is shared with
{{PropertyIndexedKeyframe}} objects, we define a generic procedure to
<dfn>convert an ECMAScript keyframe-like object to an IDL keyframe</dfn>
that takes the following parameters:

*   a <var>keyframe input</var> object,
*   an <var>&lt;&lt;OutputType&gt;&gt;</var> type,
*   an <var>allow offsets</var> boolean flag, and
*   an <var>allow lists</var> boolean flag.

The procedure is as follows:

1.  Let <var>keyframe result</var> be an <var>&lt;&lt;OutputType&gt;&gt;</var>
    IDL object with the <code>offset</code>, <code>easing</code> and

1.  Convert each property name in <var>supported properties</var>
    to the equivalent IDL attribute by applying the <a
    href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#css-property-to-idl-attribute">CSS
    property to IDL attribute</a> algorithm [[!CSSOM]].
1.  If the user agent supports animation of the 'float'
    CSS property, replace "float" in

{{PropertyIndexedKeyframe}} objects are expanded into a sequence of {{Keyframe}}
objects using the procedure defined in <a href="#processing-a-frames-argument"
section></a>.

Unlike {{Keyframe}} objects, {{PropertyIndexedKeyframe}} objects do not permit
<a>keyframe offsets</a> to be specified.

Issue: This feature is gated on implementation experience&mdash;it is currently
unknown whether the additional complexity introduced by the feature is
warranted by the improvement in usability.

<div class='informative-bg'><em>This section is non-normative.</em>

Property-indexed keyframes make it easy to create regularly spaced
animations. For example:

<pre class='example lang-javascript'>
// The following two expressions produce the same result:
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue' },
               { color: 'green' },
               { color: 'red' },
               { color: 'yellow' } ], 2000);
elem.animate({ color: [ 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'yellow' ] }, 2000);

// Likewise, for a multi-property animation, the following two
// expressions are equivalent:
elem.animate([ { color: 'blue', left: '0px' },
               { color: 'green', left: '-20px' },
               { color: 'red', left: '100px' },
               { color: 'yellow', left: '50px'} ], 2000);
elem.animate({ color: [ 'blue', 'green', 'red', 'yellow' ],
               left: [ '0px', '-20px', '100px', '50px' ] }, 2000);

// Incidentally, the following three expressions are all equivalent:
elem.animate([ { color: 'red' } ], 1000);
elem.animate({ color: [ 'red' ] }, 1000);
elem.animate({ color: 'red' }, 1000);
</pre>

</div>

As with {{Keyframe}} dictionaries, special ECMAScript-specific handling for
this type is defined in
<a href="#processing-propertyindexedkeyframe-objects" section></a>.
No handling is defined for other languages.

<pre class='idl'>

    The syntax and error-handling associated with parsing this string
    is identical to that defined for the <code>easing</code> attribute
    of the {{AnimationEffectTiming}} interface.

:   <dfn dict-member for=PropertyIndexedKeyframe>composite</dfn>

The {{SharedKeyframeList}} interface represents a sequence of {{Keyframe}}

<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

By using {{SharedKeyframeList}} objects, multiple {{KeyframeEffect}} objects
can re-use the same {{Keyframe}}s without paying the cost of parsing them
multiple times.

For example:
<pre class="example lang-javascript">
var keyframes = new SharedKeyframeList([

<h3 id="model-liveness">Model liveness</h3>

Changes made to any part of the model, cause the entire timing model to be
updated and any dependent style.


<div class="informative-bg"><em>This section is non-normative</em>

Based on the above requirement and normative requirements elsewhere
in this specification, the following invariants can be observed:

:   Changes made to the Web Animations model take effect immediately

::  For example, if the {{KeyframeEffect}}
    associated with an {{Animation}} is seeked (see <a section
    href="#setting-the-current-time-of-an-animation"></a>) via the programming
    interface, the value returned when querying the
    animation's <code>startTime</code> will reflect updated state of
    the model immediately.

    <div><pre class="example lang-javascript">
// Initially animation.effect.computedTiming.localTime is 3000
animation.currentTime += 2000;
alert(animation.effect.computedTiming.localTime); // Displays &lsquo;5000&rsquo;</pre></div>

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_GROUPS -->
    The same concept applies to more complex modifications of the
    Web Animations model such as adding and removing children from
    an {{GroupEffect}}.
<!-- @endif -->

:   Querying the computed style of a property affected by animation
    returns the fully up-to-date state of the animation

::  For example, if the used style of an element is queried
    immediately after applying a new {{Animation}} to that
    element, the result of the new animation will be
    incorporated in the value returned.

    <div><pre class="example lang-javascript">
// Set opacity to 0 immediately
elem.animate({ opacity: 0 }, { fill: 'forwards' });
alert(window.getComputedStyle(elem).opacity); // Displays &lsquo;0&rsquo;</pre></div>

    The same principle applies to attributes although the means of querying
    the animated value of an attribute depends on the interface defined for the
    attribute.
    SVG 1.1 [[!SVG11]] defines an additional interface for querying
    animated values as shown below.

    <div><pre class="example lang-javascript">
// Set width to 0 immediately
rect.animate({ width: '100px' }, { fill: 'forwards' });
alert(rect.width.animVal.value); // Displays &lsquo;100&rsquo;</pre></div>

<!-- @ifdef INCLUDE_CUSTOM_EFFECTS -->
:   Changes made to the model using the programming interface do
    <em>not</em> cause any {{EffectCallback}} functions to be
    called

::  For example, in the following code, the callback function will
    not be called until <em>after</em> the script block has
    completed during regular <a>sampling</a>.

    <div><pre class="example lang-javascript">
var timesCalled = 0;
elem.animate(function() {
  timesCalled++;
}, 10000);
alert(timesCalled); // Displays &lsquo;0&rsquo;</pre></div>

    Note: Need to spec this properly somewhere.

<!-- @endif -->

:   Changes made within the same task are synchronized such
    that the whole set of changes is rendered together

::  As a result of changes to the model taking effect immediately
    combined with ECMAScript's run-to-completion semantics,
    there should never be a situation where, for example,
    <em>only</em> the changes to specified style are rendered without
    applying animation.

    <div><pre class="example lang-javascript">
// Fade the opacity with fallback for browsers that don't
// support Element.animate
elem.style.opacity = '0';
elem.animate([ { opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 } ], 500);</pre></div>

    Note, however, that in the example above, a user agent may render a
    frame with <em>none</em> of the above changes applied.
    This might happen, for example, if rendering occurs in
    a separate process that is scheduled to run shortly after
    the above task completes but before the changes
    can be communicated to the process.

:   The value returned by the <code>currentTime</code> attribute of
    a <a>document timeline</a> will not change within a task

::  Due to the requirement on <a>timelines</a> to store the <a>time value</a>
    of the <a>global clock</a> at the start of a <a>sample</a>
    (see <a href=#timelines class=sectionRef></a>),
    querying the <code>currentTime</code> twice within
    a long block of code that is executed in the same script block
    will return the same value as shown in the following example.

    <div><pre class="example lang-javascript">
var a = document.timeline.currentTime;
// ... many lines of code ...
var b = document.timeline.currentTime;
alert(b - a); // Displays 0</pre></div>

:   The time passed to a <code>requestAnimationFrame</code> callback
    will be equal to <code>document.timeline.currentTime</code>

::  For user agent that support Timing control for script-based
    animations [[ANIMATION-TIMING]],
    HTML's <a
      href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/webappapis.html#processing-model-9"
      class="externalDFN">processing
    model</a> defines that animations are updated prior to running animation
    frame callbacks.

    Furthermore, the time passed to such callbacks is the stored value of
    the <code>Performance</code> object's <code>now()</code> method
    as recorded at the beginning of the <a>sample</a>.

    Since both <code>performance.now()</code> and <a>time values</a> from the
    <a>default document timeline</a> are measured from the
    <code>navigationStart</code> moment, and since both <a>timelines</a>
    and animation frame callbacks use the time recorded at the start of the
    <a>sample</a>, they should be equivalent.

    <div><pre class="example lang-javascript">
window.requestAnimationFrame(function(sampleTime) {
  // Displays &lsquo;0&rsquo;
  alert(sampleTime - document.timeline.currentTime);
});</pre></div>

</div>


<h2 id="integration-with-media-fragments">Integration with Media Fragments</h2>

The Media Fragments specification [[!MEDIA-FRAGS]] defines a means
for addressing a temporal range of a media resource.
The application of media fragments depends on the MIME type of the
resource on which they are specified.
For resources with the <a class="externalDFN"
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/intro.html#MIMEType">SVG MIME type</a>
[[!SVG11]], the application of temporal parameters is defined in the <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/web-animations/animation-elements.html">
Animation elements</a> specification.

Note: media fragments are defined to operate on resources based on
    their MIME type.
    As a result, temporal addressing may not be supported in all situations
    where Web Animations content is used.

<h2 id="interaction-with-page-display">Interaction with page display</h2>

HTML permits user agents to store <a class="externalDFN"
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#an-entry-with-persisted-user-state">user-agent
  defined state</a> along with a
<a class="externalDFN"
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html51/browsers.html#session-history-entry">session
history entry</a> so that as a user navigates between pages, the
previous state of the page can be restored including state such as
scroll position [[HTML5]].


User agents that pause and resume <a class="externalDFN"
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/embedded-content-0.html#media-element">media
elements</a> when the referencing document is
unloaded and traversed,
are encouraged to apply consistent handling to documents containing Web
Animations content.
If provided, this behavior SHOULD be achieved by adjusting the <a>time
values</a> of any <a>timelines</a> bound to the <a>global clock</a>.

Issue: Is this at odds with those <a>time values</a> being relative to
    <code>navigationStart</code> and with <code>requestAnimationFrame</code>
    using the same time as <code>document.timeline.currentTime</code>?


<h2 id="implementation-requirements">Implementation requirements</h2>

<h3 id="precision-of-time-values">Precision of time values</h3>

The internal representation of time values is implementation dependant
however, it is RECOMMENDED that user agents be able to represent input
time values with microsecond precision so that 0.000001 is
distinguishable from 0.0.

<h3 id="conformance-criteria">Conformance criteria</h3>

This specification defines an abstract model for animation and, as
such, for user agents that do not support scripting, there are no
conformance criteria since there is no testable surface area.

User agents that do not support scripting, however, may implement
additional technologies defined in terms of this specification in
which case the definitions provided in this specification will form
part of the conformance criteria of the additional technology.

A <dfn>conforming scripted Web Animations user agent</dfn> is a user

The following changes have been made since the <a
  href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-web-animations-20140605/">5 June
2014 Working Draft</a>:

*   Rewrote <a href="#use-cases" section></a> to provide specific
    code examples and describe scenarios that do not involve using timing groups
    which have been deferred to a subsequent level of this specification.
*   Added definition of <a>unresolved</a> <a>time values</a>.
*   Introduced <a>document timelines</a>.
*   Renamed &ldquo;not started&rdquo; timelines as <a>inactive timelines</a>.
*   Renamed animation players to <a>animations</a> (what were previously
    referred to as animations are now <a>keyframe effects</a>).
*   Made the <a>animation sequence number</a> increment on each transition
    out of the idle state (not on creation).
*   Made the association between an <a>animation</a> and a <a>timeline</a>
    optional.
*   Removed the concepts of effective timeline time and effective
    current time.
*   Renamed the source content of an <a>animation</a> (previously, player),
    to its <a>target effect</a>.
*   Removed the non-normative description of seeking behavior.
*   Added the <a>current finished promise</a> and <a>current ready
    promise</a> objects to <a>animations</a>.
*   Modified the procedure to <a>finish an animation</a> so that pause
    state is not changed by finishing.
*   Added animation <a>play states</a>.
*   Removed player events.
*   Rewrote most of the algorithms for <a>animations</a> to accommodate
    asynchronous play/pause/reverse operations.
*   Renamed animation nodes to <a>animation effects</a> and what were previously
    known as an animations to <a>keyframe effects</a>.
*   Removed the start time specific to an <a>animation effect</a> since it is
    always zero in the absence of groups effects.
*   Removed the term &lsquo;inherited time&rsquo; since, in the absence of
    animation effect-specific start times, <a>local time</a> is equivalent to
    &lsquo;inherited time&rsquo;.
*   Renamed the &ldquo;time fraction&rdquo; to <a>iteration progress</a>.
*   Deferred group effects (previously known as animation groups) to a <a
    href="https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/level-2/">subsequent level</a>
    of this specification.
    Deferring this feature also lead to the following simplifications.
    *   Deferred the <a>animation effect</a>-specific playback rate since it was
        considered to be not particularly useful without group effects and
        potentially confusing (since <a>animations</a>s also have an
        <a>animation playback rate</a>).
    *   Removed the &lsquo;repeated duration&rsquo; definition since it is
        redundant in the absence of the <a>animation effect</a>-specific
        playback rate.
*   Renamed intermediate animation values to <a>effect values</a>.
*   Added the concept of <a>animation types</a> and clarified prioritization
    in a way that can be easily extended by CSS Animations and CSS Transitions.
*   Removed motion path animation effects since this functionality can be
    achieved using the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/fxtf/motion-1/">Motion Path
    Module</a>.
*   Deferred custom effects to a <a
    href="https://w3c.github.io/web-animations/level-2/">subsequent level</a>
    of this specification.
*   Defined that <a>unresolved</a> <a>time values</a> are represented
    by <code>null</code>.
*   Added the {{DocumentTimeline}} interface.
*   Renamed the <code>getAnimationPlayers</code> method of the
    {{AnimationTimeline}} interface to
    {{AnimationTimeline/getAnimations()}}.
*   Made the {{AnimationTimeline/getAnimations()}} method on the
    {{AnimationTimeline}} and {{Animatable}} interfaces return all
    <a>animations</a> that are <em>either</em> <a>current</a> <em>or</em> <a>in
    effect</a>.
*   Moved the <code>play()</code> method of {{AnimationTimeline}} to
    a subsequent level of this specification.
*   Renamed the <code>AnimationPlayer</code> interface to {{Animation}}.
*   Updated the {{Animation}} interface:

    *   Added the {{Animation()}} constructor.
    *   Made {{Animation/startTime}} nullable.
    *   Added the {{Animation/playState}} member and corresponding
        {{AnimationPlayState}} enum.
    *   Added the {{Animation/ready}} and {{Animation/finished}} Promise
        attributes.
    *   Removed the <code>paused</code> and <code>finished</code>
        boolean attributes.
    *   Removed the <code>onfinish</code> attribute.
    *   Renamed the <code>source</code> member to {{Animation/effect}}.

*   Added a read-only version of interfaces for <a>animation effects</a> and
    related interfaces as follows:
    *   <a>Animation effects</a> are now represented by the
        {{AnimationEffectReadOnly}} interface.
    *   <a>Animation effects</a> are now represented by the
        {{KeyframeEffectReadOnly}} and {{Animation}} interfaces.
    *   <a>Keyframe effects</a> are now represented by the
        {{KeyframeEffectReadOnly}} and {{KeyframeEffect}} interfaces.
    *   A number of references to {{Animation}} and
        {{KeyframeEffect}} have been updated to refer to their read-only
        equivalents since the read-only interface is the super-interface in each
        case

*   Fixed the grammar for <a>&lt;cubic-bezier-timing-function&gt;</a> to
    match CSS Transitions.
*   Introduced the {{ComputedTimingProperties}} dictionary and
    {{AnimationEffectTimingReadOnly}} interface.
*   Moved computed timing from {{AnimationEffectReadOnly}} to a
    {{AnimationEffectReadOnly/computedTiming}} attribute of type
    {{ComputedTimingProperties}}.
*   Removed the <code>player</code> attribute from the
    {{AnimationEffectReadOnly}} interface.
*   Exposed the <a>iteration progress</a> (was &ldquo;time fraction&rdquo;) to
    script as <code>effect.computedTiming.progress</code>.
*   Made the procedure defined in <a
    href="#processing-a-frames-argument" section></a> throw an exception
    if the keyframes are not <a>loosely sorted by offset</a> or if there are any
    keyframes with an offset outside the range [0, 1].
*   Removed <code>paced</code> as a valid value for {{KeyframeEffect}}'s
    {{KeyframeEffect/spacing}} attribute.
*   Added {{PropertyIndexedKeyframe}} as a convenient way of specifying a
    list of property values.
*   Added an opaque, immutable representation of {{SharedKeyframeList}}s.
*   Added special handling for animating SVG's offset attribute on stop elements
    by using the &lsquo;svgOffset&rsquo; property name.
*   Removed the <code>MotionPathEffect</code> interface now that motion path
    animation effects have been removed.
*   Removed the <code>getCurrentAnimations</code> method from the {{Animatable}}
    interface.
*   Rewrote the section previously titled, &ldquo;Script execution and live
    updates to the model&rdquo; as the much simpler <a href=#model-liveness
    class=sectionRef></a> since many of the requirements there can be implied
    from requirements elsewhere.
